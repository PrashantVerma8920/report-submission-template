## Adding Images

To add images follow the following steps. Let's say we want to add the image of a village. We will have to store this image somewhere on the internet
so that the image is visible to anyone who has this markdown file. For this purpose we will use ImgBB.


- Step 1 : Go to ImgBB and click on start uploading, then select browse form the computer. Select the image you want to upload.

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/h1z2fGt/Img-BB-1.png" alt="ImgBB (1)" border="0"></a>

- Step 2 : Once you have done that, your page will look something like this:

<a href="https://ibb.co/Km34pjP"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fQP6zYg/Img-BB-2.png" alt="Img-BB-2" border="0"></a>

Click on the pencil icon to edit the size of the image.

- Step 3 : Adjust the size of the image. Usually 500 is good if you want images that are neither too big or small. But this is up to you to decide.

After specifiyng the width, click on upload.

- Step 4 : Select HTML Full Linked from the Embed Codes dropdown. This link is ready to be used. Just copy this link and paste it in the md file.

<a href="https://ibb.co/GTBF9k2"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/ws3Y7CW/Img-BB-4.png" alt="Img-BB-4" border="0"></a>

- Step 5 : Paste the link in the md file. We have an image of a village!

<p align = "center">
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/QX22q87/Village.jpg" alt="Village" border="0"></a>
</p>

<p align = "center">
<b>Fig x.1 Village </b></figcaption>
</p>

**A note on captioning figures** : Just Sandwich the link between the "center" codes (see code to understand). Finally Label the image. Here the label is "x.1 Village", "x.1" because it is the first image in the xth Chapter, and "Village" because this word describes what exactly this image is.
