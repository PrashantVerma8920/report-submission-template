- Using the zotero connecter we can easily add new refernces to this folder, as described in the video. For example if we want to reference the site which has
information regarding the population in villages of india.

Visit the site and save it in the appropriate file in Zotero with the help of the Zotero Connector.

- This adds a new reference in the folder.

- Collect all the refernces in this way. After we have all the references for each sub team we can create a final folder having all the references. This can then be easily used to produce the Reference section in our report.
