### [Abstract](#table-of-contents)




### [1. Vocational Training](#table-of-contents)


##### The different ways in which the villagers can be trained by the means of vocational training are:
Vocational training can be defined as equipping the villagers with skills worth making a living.
The government is also advised by independent bodies like the National Council of Vocational Training or NCVT for providing these training and apprenticeship programs. It manages training programs and looks into certification matters. 
One such program is described below-
-   **Television and Radio Repairing-** 
The unemployed villagers can be vocationally trained for television and radio repairing by the means of ITI courses, Polytechnic, or the courses funded by the State Government. Monetary incentives can be provided to the villagers who opt for these courses, which they can repay once they start earning after the completion of the course. Not only this, the ITI and Polytechnic courses will also open new fields of opportunities for the villagers. They can work in any small-scale industries of their respective fields. The villagers who do any type of work-related to electronics can also take part in this vocational training since this would enhance their skills.
-   **Car Mechanic-**
Similar to the courses of television and radio repairing mentioned, ITI courses and Polytechnic courses can also introduce courses in car mechanic training. Even, the courses could also be done in a hybrid way where villagers could be taught skills at certain garages present in the respective region. This will also fulfill the demand and supply of the workforce needed at a garage.
- **Tour Guidance at tourist places:** 
Unemployed youths of 18-28 age are the target group. They need to be taught common languages like English, Regional languages, and some specific languages whose tourists visit the most. They need to know the history of related places and information regarding transportation, stay at hotels, etc.
- **Pottery and clay classes:**
Upskilling the traditional pottery prevailing in rural areas with modern modifications by providing them tools, techniques, and markets and providing information regarding these. Establishing a design and innovations system with the help of these tools and techniques that will take care of designing suitable products as per demand.
- **Lab-technician courses:** 
It is a fourth-degree secondary education specialized course.  It can be available in the form of part-time secondary education or additional training.
This profession requires knowledge and expertise of Chemistry mainly, analytical thinking skills, knowledge of English, etc. So, the right set of people to choose for its vocational training are people that fall in the category of 'educated unemployed. The government can implement some schemes to train these people to instill some expertise in them and make them perfect for this job.
- **Sericulture:**
 Sericulture is mainly done on the leaves of Mulberry, Eri, and Muga seeds. It can be modernized by methods such as modernization of seed preparation, plowing, weeding, terrace making's disinfection, replacing weeding and old plants by high yielding variety plants. We can also improve this by using high-tech machines like deflossing machines, for cocoons for seed preparation. So, the government should implement some schemes to help rural people to how to use these machines and technologies. It will also give people employment and help the production of silk.
 


### [2. Education](#table-of-contents)

- What are the specifications for technology interventions at the inter-community level?

1. We can teach them basic communication skills in english or local language through which we can place them in customer FAQ section in companies. If they know their local language, then just a bit of training is required to make them communicate in a sophisticated manner and an effort to link them to such companies . This job can be done from anywhere like at your own place too. So this can be a solution.

    Cost- around 1500-2000 rs. Hence, it is a cost efficient solution.
                                                                                                            
    

  
  

2. We can give stipends to students in schools. The reason that a large portion of rural kids don’t go to school is because they can contribute more (financially ) by working in a farm or helping in the household chores. Giving stipends to students (or their parents) solves this problem. This is similar to how we pay PhD students and research scholars at colleges. We can also make this stipend performance based (based on grades) or effort based (based on the work done or time spent) to ensure that children have an incentive to work hard. This solution will alleviate poverty and promote education.

    The cost can be around Rs 5,000 -10,000 per student per month. This may seem expensive but a more educated workforce will essentially pay for itself in the long run (by taxes and other contributions to the country’s growth). 
	                                                                                                                                

  
  
  

3. Different coaching centres can be establised for students to learn real-world skills which are relevant for jobs such as Excel, AutoCAD etc. The government can subsidise the fees of coaching and can also establish government-run coaching centres similar to government schools. A good initiative for attracting more students in these institutions can be appointing teachers as someone from the same village who is eligible and have the required knowledge.

    The cost for establishment of such centres may cost around 1,00,000. But it can recovered and cost of the teachers and employees can be paid by the student fees. Students getting subsidy will cost the government Rs 5,000 -10,000 per student per month.
                                                                                                                            

  

4. Machine translation models using Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing can be developed. Recent state-of-the-art models like GPT-2 and GPT-3 (developed by OpenAI) match human language skills competency on a multitude of tasks. 
    Developing such a tool would greatly help rural kids access a wide range of knowledge (books, papers, articles) which are currently inaccessible since the majority of them are only in English and not in regional languages.

  

    Estimated Cost:  
	Time: 1 year  
	20 developers at 30 LPA = 6Cr  
	Operational cost = 2Cr  
	Computational cost = 2Cr  
	Total: 10Cr
                                                                                                                        


### [3. Infrastructure](#table-of-contents)


#### Transport

It's no secret that transportation continues to be a challenge for rural communities. With shortage of funds, difficulties in service frequency, wider travel zones, and a lack of basic services when compared to urban public transportation, there is an urgent need to develop rural transport. With the emergence of taxi services such as Uber, Ola, passengers now have a higher level of expectation when it comes to selecting a mode of transportation that is convenient for them. Rural communities, on the other hand, face a different set of challenges.

The first and foremost step is to develop proper roadways and connectivity across rural and urban areas. Need for government tie-ups and schemes is higher than ever. New projects and processes that will ensure the sustainability of roads investments need to be undertaken. Involving the rural community itself in the planning and monitoring processes will enhance group ownership. Community based organizations can be trained to monitor the quality of roads being built and identify issues at various stages of construction and maintenance.  

The next step is to make it simple and efficient for more people to use public transportation. On-Demand Public transportation/ Demand-Responsive Transportation (DRT), is a method of expanding the reach of a traditional public transportation service. This means that vehicles can serve a larger area and reach more passengers. DRT technology is a great way to improve fleet efficiency and provide a way for people to book public transportation.

Use of a data-driven method to optimise the system is great a way to improve the following: 

1. Increase coverage and give passengers more options
2. Increase your customer base
3. Provide a sustainable mode of transportation 
4. Make changes to inefficient fixed-route transit services
5. Improve passenger capture and integration with the larger transportation network 
6. Reduce reliance on single occupancy vehicle use 
7. Extend service hours and connect more passengers to amenities like medical appointments, retail stores, and job opportunities.


#### Electricity

Rural electricity has five major aspects: 

* Establishment of rural electricity infrastructure and providing connectivity to households     
* A sufficient supply of power of the desired quality  
* Affordably priced electricity supply 
* Providing clean, environmentally friendly, and long-term power in an efficient manner
    
A unified model for implementation is required for faster, more reliable, and effective rural electrification. In this regard, an integrated policy framework would be beneficial.

Some of the solutions can be:
1.  Solar streetlights/community lighting for village electrification and lighting in public places.
2.  Solar/Lantern charging stations that are managed by a local entrepreneur
3.  Mini grids of various sizes that are powered by solar, wind, small hydro, or biomass. These are viable candidates for a long-term business model for rural electrification.
4.  Grid powered by renewable energy at the MW level, with smart controllers and appropriate energy storage technologies. These grids can meet the need for dependable 24 hour power in rural areas.
5.  It is critical to advance technology in hybrid systems for mini grids and energy storage systems for balancing supply and demand in mini grids or distributed generation in rural areas.
    
#### Water

There are still some villages that lack proper water facilities, and a continuous supply of water will have a great effect on Health and Farming . Moreover, the women travelled to far places to fetch drinking water. There was no provision to access clean water and remove pollutants .

Understanding the depth of the issue , An NGO named AROEHAN procured solar-powered water pumps to lift water from streams and other sources. The water was lifted and transferred to a tank placed at a common public space in the village. The water from the tank falls with gravity and passes through a filter that purifies water, which was accessed through a tap.

##### Possible Solution :

A village as a community can implement the same by funding it themselves, a smaller village requires a smaller system thus not costing way too much, they can communicate the same with the governing body so that a budget is allocated for that, Since its Solar powered its will be a one time investment with little maintainace required over the years.

#### Houses, living area

Rural India is home to nearly three-fourths of the population. People in these areas have largely unmet housing needs. 

The major housing issues are related to the following: 

1. Houses in rural areas do not provide adequate protection against wind, rain, and cold. 
2. They do not have adequate lighting and ventilation. 
3. There is no separate arrangement for keeping animals in rural houses. 
4. There is no adequate provision for basic sanitation and drinking water. 
5. The surroundings of rural houses do not meet hygiene standards. 
6. Insects, rodents, and other pests infest rural homes, causing health problems. 
7. Rural homes have high maintenance costs that the poor cannot afford. 
8. Rural houses are incapable of providing protection against natural disasters such as floods.

Some possible solutions are:

1.  Mobile homes - great for rural communities who often need to commute or changes places like in rajasthan. 
2.  Renovation of old houses and more use of local sustainable materials
3.  Energy efficient homes using renewable energy which will also make it cost efficient
4.  Increase affordability with sustainability- Think local and simple. Imitating the urban planning and infrastructure won't solve the problem.
5.  Rural areas provide numerous opportunities for energy and water conservation, as well as local food production. 
    
Windmills, rain wells, gardens, and farms for food are all ideal in rural areas. Furthermore, promoters of rural housing may discover locally abundant odd materials that could be used as insulation.

#### Mobile towers

One of the major problems faced by rural people is bad cell phone reception. Several things can cause bad cell phone reception. A common issue is a distance from the nearest tower. Like any other type of frequency wave, cell waves degrade over a distance which means the further from the tower, the weaker they are.

However, we can’t get cell service anywhere. If there’s no tower signal at all near a location, we will not be able to get cell service. But many locations that seem to not have cell service are reached by a weak tower signal that doesn’t do much on its own. In those locations, we can get cell service with the help of a cell signal booster.

A cell phone signal booster takes any amount of signal from a cell tower, no matter how weak, and boosts it. This helps you get better data and call connections in remote areas as long as there is any tower signal at all.   Signal boosters draw in weak signals and amplify them up to 32 times, creating robust, reliable coverage for your mobile devices.

#### Communication systems: 

India’s rural areas are sparsely covered by telecom services, in part due to not being considered a feasible business by most telecom companies. As the growth of urban areas continues, the gap between rural and urban areas keeps on increasing, due to differences in mobile connectivity.

Providing rural populations with wireless broadband and mobile connectivity is the need of the hour. Giving them access to cost efficient and fast-deployment technologies to improve the connection to the outside world is required. Taking both technological and economic considerations into account, some possible solutions can be: 

1. The International Telecommunication Union, the Universal Postal Union (UPU), the Government of Bhutan, and the Government of India have teamed up to use post offices to deliver digital access to rural areas. This scheme could be implemented across India, providing connectivity to rural areas. Because post offices are already in place, using them as a launch pad saves money.
      A VSAT system with technology was used to provide telecom connectivity to the post offices. Launching e-post services, in addition to computerization of post offices and internet access, could be a component of the plan. It entails printing emails and mailing them to the intended recipient, thus shortening mail delivery time.
      Post offices all over the nation can be used as connectivity hubs.
2. We can identify the need and the most cost-efficient solutions by analysis of the population clusters in the rural villages. 
      For Dense Rural Areas, where there are over 200,000 people in an Access Area, and the need increases with time, an optical fibre network is the most suitable, with a Wireless Access Network connecting each population cluster.
      For Sparse Areas, the choice is dependent on the number of population clusters and the amount of bandwidth needed. A satellite is appropriate for around 20 clusters and less than 2 Mbps, while an optical fibre is suitable for more that 20 clusters with a bandwidth of over 2 Mbps.
      In Extremely Sparse Areas, each population cluster must be served by a satellite link. 
3. The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) suggests a structure that improves digital and financial literacy, generates material in regional and local languages, and includes stakeholders in the process.



### [4. Food Security](#table-of-contents)

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/z2CBNYgv8XF7WHiBXvJyavVmu_ga_S6icOwwLoD7XzlNxFCuPvM_-MQMAaH4YmkJ9QKX58PL-JixwoBt3R7UFYNUBBSPx7grxK9UUnv3OSLe69VZCxGguyDLb8N4XaCen5OMMnnL)

-  Food availability:   Food availability means that people must have access to sufficient quantities of healthy and good-quality food. This can be done by improving crop productivity by using cross-breed crops, better irrigation facilities, soil monitoring and shifting to modern agricultural practices. We have looked over this category and some ways to improve it using various technological innovations in previous reports.
    
-   Food access: Includes reducing post-harvest loss by improving storage, refrigeration, transport, etc. and building a better distribution system to ensure that each individual have access to a sufficient healthy and nutritious diet.
    
-   Food use and utilization: Food utilization ensures that other than having access to good quality food, people eat a diversity of foods to meet their nutritional needs by eating a balanced diet rich in every essential nutrients.
    

  

#### Food access:

Since crops grow seasonally, food storage solutions are required to maintain regular and sustainable supply of food throughout the year. Some potential solutions for food access issues can be:

-   Due to high upfront cost, setting of silos or warehouses is difficult for small farmers therefore affordable off grid solar powered hermetic storage solutions or affordable configurable aeration mechanisms can help farmers for better storage.
    
-   Using advanced techniques like electro thermal treatment, ultrasound or dehydration freezing, ozone treatment and nano technology for better yield and shelf life.
    
-   ML-based aeration mechanism that can be attached to any food truck for food storage to control temperature, humidity and ethylene levels can help in making a robust cold chain for food transportation.
    
-   Software based community service to connect people in rural areas connecting service providers and people needing service leading to an efficient supply chain.
    
-   The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can tackle the problems of the current food supply chain like food wastage, bulk production, food preservation, food adulteration, supply-demand matching, fraud prevention and counterfeiting. The use of data-driven collaborative forecasting of demand can help in effective supply-demand matching. Effective product tracking and tracing, and synchronization of freight transport through better transport scheduling can compress the time along the supply chain. Improving logistics, loading and unloading facilities, connecting logistic companies with producers for better transportation of food.
    

  
  

#### Food use and utilization:

According to a paper published in journal food policy based on 2011 census data, 3 out of 4 people living in rural India cannot afford a nutritious diet. Even if they spent their entire income on food, almost 2 out of 3 would not be able to afford the cheapest possible diet fulfilling necessary requirements. 330 gm of cereals, 75 gm of pulses a day, 300 gm of dairy, 100 gm of fruit, and 300 gm of vegetables which should include at least 100 gm of dark green leafy vegetables, are required for nutritionally adequate diet for adult women as as per the guidelines by the National Institute for Nutritions.

We know that a main factor in deciding how much a person needs to eat is calorific value , but rarely is it seen from where those calorific values are we getting , below table shows how much calorific value a portion of nuts , fresh fruits and salads contain.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dQ500v6cjSSti-V4GZ_4QREVVWpehu89mxMRfNjFGjHgrB7gYJV1A3IYG5uwPwT5wMqAAE0jF4RBB8jRgIT3JuJPypShp3vYLAWNmWyQdrqLIsqVQeJyzkV1NkrjT47IqlacBNAo)

  

To ensure proper food utilization, people need a balanced diet. The below table shows what level of activity and based on your gender how much portions of cereals , pulses and other dietary items an individual has to eat.

  
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WQMP_1-7jpzhzyfIzr3T3EBbrw_uBWE7Lpjle8aszoawbG9CsZJ3gNDv2mypPqaGRL5ibiHJXTvgaOQglB5ZCgUFZDbGEvL1jY2nkVFfz7qc0wO8wRGK8E3Ow1eLwTSX03GjP4UE)  

From these above shown national dietary guidelines for a healthy life, some steps we can take to ensure food utilization in rural areas are:

-   An information programme should be started in rural India, educating them of how much minimum food of various types they need to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
    
-   A more village targeted logistics and planning system should be developed , so that each village can grow whatever farmers are comfortable with ( planning as such a group of villages fulfill all dietary needs locally ), so that cost can be brought down ( logistical and transport , whole village is in either support of one type of crop so supply chain cost can be brought down and increased specialization in that particular crop or fruit will increase productivity ).
    
-   A community kitchen can be established,where the village as a whole works as a single co-operative unit, and co-operative kitchen feeds the whole village, this will result in a more organized structure , thus it will be easy to maintain a nutrition profile.
    
-   Free or cheap ration provided by Public Distribution System should also monitor nutritional needs of a family through some portal or app which need to be updated by ration distributors in rural areas, and a predictive ML model should be implemented to predict the target of providing nutritious diet in each household eradicating the major problem of malnutrition.
    
-   Awareness programs need to be conducted and strict monitoring on nutritional level in maternal diet and diet of children in the age group of 1-5 need to be done. Involvement of women is more important because meals of family are looked after by mothers in rural India and women participation encourages other women of the village also.
    
-   Effective food utilization depends in large measure on knowledge within the household of food storage and processing techniques. This is because most people in rua areas have very little knowledge on how to store and refrigerate things. Therefore, proper awareness of refrigeration guidelines should be publicized using the packaging of packed food and using radio and tv commercials for no packaged food.

### [5. Cleanliness](#table-of-contents)

## Problem

**Disposal of solid waste**

## Solution

**Biodegradable**

-   Composting

Composting can be done with any organic waste, such as vegetable waste,
garden trash, agricultural waste, cow manure, and so on. Meat scraps and
bones, as well as very greasy waste, should be avoided because they
attract rodents and insects and cause odors. Composting can be done
successfully in any corner of a house yard or field without the need for
a structure. A compost pit, on the other hand, may retain heat, which
helps to speed up the composting process while also improving
aesthetics.

-   Vermicomposting

Unlike traditional composting, which relies on natural processes to
break down organic matter, vermicomposting employs a variety of worm
species to break down organic matter and produce nutrient-rich compost.
A vermi-tank or a vermi-bed can be used for vermicomposting.

**Non-biodegradable**

-   Recycling

Waste such as plastic, glass, metal, and so on can be sold to a
kabadiwala.

## Problem

**Open defecation and improper waste management is still prominent in
many villages which contaminates surroundings and contributes to the
spread of many infectious diseases.**

## Solution

The government should provide gram panchayats and local municipalities
with special grants for scientific waste management. Despiste of
disposing the garbage in pits , it should be used as a source of energy.
Municipalities should implement technology to convert garbage into
manure and use it to generate fuel.

## Problem

**Poor Sanitation**

## Solution

The pit toilet and the flush toilet are the two most widely utilized
sanitation systems today. Waterborne sewage has been shown to be
ineffective in meeting sanitation needs in poor countries. Because the
systems are too expensive to deliver to everyone, they are usually
limited to the top and middle classes. Currently, almost 90% of sewage
in developing-country cities is released untreated, damaging rivers,
lakes, and coastal areas. Pit toilets have their own set of drawbacks,
particularly in highly populated places, where they pose a serious risk
of contaminating groundwater.

## Problem

**Residential burning of wood and other biomass used predominantly for
cooking and heating causing pollution.**

## Solution

Ventilation plays an important part in reducing smoke and health risks,
and the locals should be made aware of this. Subsidized better stoves
can be offered to the rural people. The Integrated Rural Energy Planning
Scheme can provide free upgraded stoves with chimneys (i.e. smoke-less
earthen stoves) to the poorest segment of the tribal region in order to
avoid the health risks associated with the consumption of fuel wood. The
poor and middle-class should be discouraged from using clay pots and
should be insisted on using aluminum kitchenware, pressure cookers, and
energy-efficient stoves in order to minimize fuel wood usage and air
pollution. The wealthier people in society can be insisted for shifting
to biogas/gas stoves by offering them loans and subsidies.

## Problem

**Disposal of Liquid waste**

## Solution 

**Types of Liquid waste : waste water, fats, used oils, sludges or
hazardous household liquids.** There are 6 commonly used processes for
disposal of liquid waste. But incineration is the best method for
disposal of hazardous liquid waste. The heat produced by a multiple
hearth furnace will dispose of hazardous wastes like acids, scrap
materials, slag, rock tailings, oils, and other chemicals. Any water
left behind is clear and free of contaminants.

## Problem

**25% of rural India’s households don’t have access to sanitation and
about 42.9% of the households in the rural areas used hand pump as the
principal source of drinking water**

## Solution

Villagers don’t know about what are the harms of this poor sanitization
and how it is affecting them so, they should be educated about this
through various interactive online courses or videos about it in their
own language so that they can understand the benefits. Government should
also take help from these villagers to identify the villages with this
problem. They can deploy an app in which villagers can put in the
request for a proper toilet and drinking water source for their area and
can also get rewards for this task. This way the Govt can identify and
easily solve the problem.
