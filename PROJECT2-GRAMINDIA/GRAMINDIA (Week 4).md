## Problem

**Disposal of solid waste**

## Solution

**Biodegradable**

-   Composting

Composting can be done with any organic waste, such as vegetable waste,
garden trash, agricultural waste, cow manure, and so on. Meat scraps and
bones, as well as very greasy waste, should be avoided because they
attract rodents and insects and cause odors. Composting can be done
successfully in any corner of a house yard or field without the need for
a structure. A compost pit, on the other hand, may retain heat, which
helps to speed up the composting process while also improving
aesthetics.

-   Vermicomposting

Unlike traditional composting, which relies on natural processes to
break down organic matter, vermicomposting employs a variety of worm
species to break down organic matter and produce nutrient-rich compost.
A vermi-tank or a vermi-bed can be used for vermicomposting.

**Non-biodegradable**

-   Recycling

Waste such as plastic, glass, metal, and so on can be sold to a
kabadiwala.

## Problem

**Open defecation and improper waste management is still prominent in
many villages which contaminates surroundings and contributes to the
spread of many infectious diseases.**

## Solution

The government should provide gram panchayats and local municipalities
with special grants for scientific waste management. Despiste of
disposing the garbage in pits , it should be used as a source of energy.
Municipalities should implement technology to convert garbage into
manure and use it to generate fuel.

## Problem

**Poor Sanitation**

## Solution

The pit toilet and the flush toilet are the two most widely utilized
sanitation systems today. Waterborne sewage has been shown to be
ineffective in meeting sanitation needs in poor countries. Because the
systems are too expensive to deliver to everyone, they are usually
limited to the top and middle classes. Currently, almost 90% of sewage
in developing-country cities is released untreated, damaging rivers,
lakes, and coastal areas. Pit toilets have their own set of drawbacks,
particularly in highly populated places, where they pose a serious risk
of contaminating groundwater.

## Problem

**Residential burning of wood and other biomass used predominantly for
cooking and heating causing pollution.**

## Solution

Ventilation plays an important part in reducing smoke and health risks,
and the locals should be made aware of this. Subsidized better stoves
can be offered to the rural people. The Integrated Rural Energy Planning
Scheme can provide free upgraded stoves with chimneys (i.e. smoke-less
earthen stoves) to the poorest segment of the tribal region in order to
avoid the health risks associated with the consumption of fuel wood. The
poor and middle-class should be discouraged from using clay pots and
should be insisted on using aluminum kitchenware, pressure cookers, and
energy-efficient stoves in order to minimize fuel wood usage and air
pollution. The wealthier people in society can be insisted for shifting
to biogas/gas stoves by offering them loans and subsidies.

## Problem

**Disposal of Liquid waste**

## Solution 

**Types of Liquid waste : waste water, fats, used oils, sludges or
hazardous household liquids.** There are 6 commonly used processes for
disposal of liquid waste. But incineration is the best method for
disposal of hazardous liquid waste. The heat produced by a multiple
hearth furnace will dispose of hazardous wastes like acids, scrap
materials, slag, rock tailings, oils, and other chemicals. Any water
left behind is clear and free of contaminants.

## Problem

**25% of rural India’s households don’t have access to sanitation and
about 42.9% of the households in the rural areas used hand pump as the
principal source of drinking water**

## Solution

Villagers don’t know about what are the harms of this poor sanitization
and how it is affecting them so, they should be educated about this
through various interactive online courses or videos about it in their
own language so that they can understand the benefits. Government should
also take help from these villagers to identify the villages with this
problem. They can deploy an app in which villagers can put in the
request for a proper toilet and drinking water source for their area and
can also get rewards for this task. This way the Govt can identify and
easily solve the problem.
