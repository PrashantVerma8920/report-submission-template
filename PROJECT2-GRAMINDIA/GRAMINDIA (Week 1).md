### [2. Education](#table-of-contents)

#### Government School
According to Annual Status of Education Report(ASER) - 2021, it has been observed that from year 2018 to year 2021 around 4% increase in government school enrollments and became 70.3%.Survey says that most of the government enrolled students describing their reason of study in government school is financial issue. In Indian villages poverty ratio is 32.75% which is very less compared to urban having 8.8%.

- Studying in government schools we can say is that there is no competitive environment which is needed a bit for your growth. 
- Attention of teachers towards students which is very less in most of the government schools situated in villages.
- A student living in village has less chance of having friend circle motivated to study. As at the end of the day they all are contributing to their father's profession and for the rest of the time enjoying with friends.
That is my observation in a remote village of Gujarat.

####  Private School

#####  Living :
Living will be same as average person in a village. Not spending much on extra services but only ensuring essential services.
#####  Earning :
- Low paying Govt. jobs for high school educated
- Farming
- Cattle farming
- Working as laborer
- Own shops / small family business


##### Savings :
As being educated , they will be familiar with advantaged of banks. So most of them will have their money in banks.

##### Spend :

- Food
- Education of children
- Health (using govt. facilities)
- Electricity
- Cloths
- Transportation

##### Important resources they have :

- Cattles
- Fields

##### What do they might lack :
Access to services such as electricity , hospitality, higher education too as they could not pursue college.



#### Education -- Bachelors:
According to the latest census, only 8.15% of people in India are graduates, and approximately one-third of these are from rural areas. 
- Standard of living: Since these are people that are somewhat more educated than the rest of the rural population, their lifestyle is quite good than the rest of the rural people.
- Earning: Average income of graduates in the village is higher than the people having less education. Mostly, they earn by teaching in some schools or some nearby colleges, serving in the army. And in some extreme cases, if they don't find some appropriate source of income, they take agriculture as their main source of income.
- How do they spend: Normally, it will be for the education of children, house maintenance(like electricity bills, water bills, etc.), food, clothes, etc. 
- Savings: Most of them save some part of their income in banks. Since these belong to the educated part of villages, some of them may be familiar with investment in stocks, real estate, etc., and can use some part of their savings in these investments.   
- Important resources: Since belonging to a village, most of them are expected to have their main resources as land, some cattle. They also have education as one of their important resource.
- Resources lacking and problems: Some of the main resources they lack are basic facilities like regular electricity, proper medical facilities, pure drinking water, etc. Also, due to lack of opportunities in villages, most of them cannot work as per their potential and have to settle for less.

#### Education-- Masters:
According to the data of the survey performed in 2011, only 6.7% of the villagers are graduates or above, with 7.6% and 5.4% being the percentage for men and women graduates, respectively. There are as many as 3077 villages in India which do not even have a single graduate person. The rural post graduate women have unemployment percentage as high as 36.8%, which is about 13.3% for rural postgraduate men.
##### Define the people based on your category
- Villagers can be defined as the people who suffer from the unavailability of optimum resources of education in comparison to the urban areas, owing to their less literacy rate. They can also be referred to as the people doing jobs in post offices, banks, government schools that are in the rural areas.

##### How do they live?
- The standard of living in villages is not an indicator of any educational or economic status. It majorly depicts the availability of facilities available at ease in villages. The villagers lead a simple lifestyle where the availability of groceries, health services and other facilities is less and harder to fetch as compared to the urban areas.

##### What do they earn?
- The income of postgraduates is broadly divided into three components where one is the postgraduates involved in government jobs and residing in villages which have an average annual income of 6 lacs-7 lacs while the others are the one who are involved in agricultural or any small-scale business where the average annual income is around 3 lacs- 4 lacs. While one is category of unemployed postgraduates which is 17.1% of the postgraduates residing in villages with no income at all.

#####  How do they shop, save, and spend?
- The expenditure in rural areas is less as compared to the urban areas since the available facilities and price of goods are less and, most of the villager's own cattle and agricultural land which saves their expenditures on food items. In contrast to the urban areas, the statistics show that villagers have higher savings.

##### What are the most important resources they have?
- The most valuable resource in the case of post graduate villagers is the knowledge that they possess. Apart from that, most of the villagers have land and livestock as their primary resources.

##### What is that they lack?
- They are lacking opportunities for future growth. The facilities, whether they be in terms of connectivity, monetary, health or any other sphere, appear to be lesser in comparison to the urban areas which are resulting in drastic levels of unemployment. One reason for unemployment is the quality of education imparted to the youth, which industries do not find attractive enough.

##### What are the problems faced by them?
- The villagers and their families are exposed to poor foundation skills, financial constraints, lack of equipment and digital literacy. Obtaining higher education becomes relatively harder for villagers as compared to people residing in urban areas due to the lesser number of universities present at their proximity. Not to mention, the financial constraints associated with villagers, as a result of which many are not able to go to urban areas to achieve higher education. Apart from that, there is also a lack of awareness about what career and path to pursue further among villagers.




#### No School 
Education plays a crucial role in shaping an individual’s personality. Many people in rural India are deprived of this basic right. The number of schools in rural India is very less in comparison to the urban areas, with few rural areas having no schools at all. Most students who have no schools in the nearby areas, need to travel to far-flung areas in order to reach their schools. The lack of transport hinders them to do so. In India, we also have many tribes, who don’t have any fixed location to stay and travel from one place to another the whole year. These people also don’t get the right to education. The Indian patriarchal society also poses another challenge where many people don’t allow their daughters to go to school. This provides another hindrance in the education of the female gender. The pandemic offered another issue where the education shifted to the online mode. The way of teaching in rural places is primitive and these people couldn’t equip themselves with modern day gadgets and internet facilities to continue their education. 
Thus, the rural people see education as an expense rather than an investment. They prefer their children to earn and work. Along with this, the lack of proper schooling with good infrastructure facilities hinders education for many people. There is also a lack of guidance on the importance of education for both children and their parents.



####  Distribution of children enrolled in schools across rural India in 2019

### [3. Gender](#table-of-contents)


#### Who are the people we refer to as villagers?

 Women in Rural India constitute about half of the rural population. A little more than 48 per cent of the Indian rural population is female, according to the Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011. 
 
#### How do they live?

Farmers, wage earners, and entrepreneurs are all essential positions for women in the rural economy. They are also responsible for the well-being of their family members, including providing food and caring for youngsters and the old. They are less often literate than their male counterparts. Typically, they don’t get to own land. Women work in agriculture, cattle, hunting, and forestry, among other traditional jobs and subsistence activities. They perform critical responsibilities in their communities as family caregivers and keepers of traditional knowledge, which is critical to their people's survival and integrity, as well as their livelihoods and resilience. 

#### What do they earn?

Rural women workers are less likely to engage in wage employment than women in urban areas, and when they do, they tend to earn less than their male counterparts. Rural women, on average, are paid 25 percent less than men, and they typically work longer hours. They are also often engaged in labor-intensive work under challenging conditions, lacking occupational safety and health measures and social protection.

#### How do they shop?

- 84% travel outside their village to nearby city or district headquarters to make purchases and bring the products home.
- Majority of rural women consumers buy high-value goods – which again is a myth buster for companies thinking that women mostly prefer to purchase low-value goods.
- 37% of the rural women consumers make purchases on their own. The figure is as high as 40% for working women in rural India.
    
#### How do they save?

The study identified that there are principally two major ways through which rural women save their finances. These are in cash or kind forms. The cash methods of saving include saving through banks, financial self-help associations, money lending, and house saving. The non-cash methods of saving include purchasing land, storage of agricultural produce, livestock investment, rentals, and building houses. Individual analysis showed that the non-cash method was the major way of saving by the rural women farmers. This was testified by the 90% and 60% of the women that save through non-cash and cash methods respectively. However, identified primary non-cash methods of saving were an investment in livestock production (88%) and storage of farm produce (78.4). The major cash methods of saving among the rural women farmers are; house saving (79.6%) and money lending (45.4%).

#### How do they spend their money?

For an average rural Indian, food accounted for 52.9% of their overall expenditure, including 10.8 percent for cereals and cereal substitutes, 8 percent for milk and milk products, 7.9 percent on beverages, refreshments, and processed food, and 6.6 percent on vegetables.
Among the non-food items, rural Indians spent about 8 percent on Fuel / Light, 7 percent on Clothing & Footwear, 6.7 percent on medical expenses, 3.5 percent on Education, 4.2 percent on conveyance, and 8.5 percent on consumer services and durables.
In this rural area, women mostly spend their money on Food, Clothing, and medical expenses.

####  What do they aspire to do?

- Some women might have hobbies like singing, dancing, acting or wants to play some sports for which the facilities are not available in villages.
- In villages, people think that the girl has to marry and go to her husband’s house so they don’t teach them. So girls don’t get higher or even basic education in villages through which they may become independent.
- Proper sanitization facilities are also not present in villages.

####  What are the most important resources they have?

- In the village, most of the women are homemakers, and they rely on their husband’s earnings.  
- They also help in agricultural work and collect wood or water for their family.

####  What do they Lack?

- Sanitation facilities  
- Basic facilities like fuel, tap water  
- Proper education (considerably less than male counterpart)  
- Financial independence

#### Requirements

- Women require appropriate Sanitation facilities  
- Need of clean fuel (LPG)
- Access to equal education at a young age and no early stopping  
- Availability of some quick method to avoid reliance on male members of the family to shop daily necessity things
- Equality in representation in political arena
- Equal access to healthcare
- Better access to water
