### [Abstract](#table-of-contents)



### [1. Unemployment](#table-of-contents)




### [2. Education](#table-of-contents)

To improve education quality in a village we are suggesting the
following solutions.

-   **Providing free Internet connection with smartphones:**

    Since there is a lack of high-quality education in villages. So we
    can provide free internet connection under some government scheme.
    Using smartphones they can learn from the national level teachers.
    There are many platforms like Udemy, Coursera and Youtube that
    provides education with good teachers across the world. As per a
    recent survey done by ASER, 26.1% of rural families don’t have
    access to smartphones at home.(“27.9% Rural Households Bought
    Smartphone for Kids’ Studies Amid Pandemic: Survey” 2021)

    Smartphones should be configured in such a way that they can only be
    for educational purposes this will prevent misuse of smartphones.

-   **Providing access to paid courses on the internet:**

    As most of the structured learning resources are paid on the
    internet. So, we can provide access to those paid courses at a
    subsidised rate so that they can afford it. They can acquire an
    organised, high-quality education through these paid classes,
    similar to what they would get at a premium school. This will have a
    great impact on the future of a student studying in a village with
    limited access to such premium institutions. Students from villages
    will also be able to compete with a student studying in the urban
    area having access to quality education.

-   **Linking Individuals:**

    We can link various subject experts or students good at subjects
    with village students. The village students can’t have access to
    tuition or coaching facilities, so we can provide them with this
    help with students( like NSS) or various NGOs can be linked to it.
    In this way we can make a platform for villagers so that they can
    get access to such help.

-   **Encouraging Ed tech sector:**

    The government needs to encourage the Ed tech sector to provide
    services to students from rural areas as well. Clearly more needs to
    be done by the private sector such as making content available in
    regional languages, making services targeted towards the
    underprivileged etc. This could be done by providing tax benefits
    and government funding.

-   **Modern Education Centre:**

    Modern Education centres can be set up by Governments/Private
    Institutions to provide, where classes of different fields of expert
    teachers can be streamed live for mass students. Students, This
    facility can be used as schools or coaching for the various fields
    to get world-class teaching from the best teachers around the world.

-   **Better translation software for regional languages :**

    74 percent of children in India study in their mother tongue and
    this number is even higher in rural areas. Moreover, 44 percent of
    engineering students want to be taught in their mother tongue. This
    shows most students prefer to learn and are more comfortable in
    their mother tongue. However, most educational content - books,
    articles, videos, research papers - are in English. Furthermore,
    these increase and change at such a fast rate that it is impossible
    to manually translate all the content. Hence, better AI and NLP
    software will need to be developed. Over the last few years, OpenAI
    has made huge strides to make models with performance matching human
    language skills (GPT2 and more recently GPT3). Work will need to be
    done to use this model in regional language translation contexts and
    develop applications to do so.(*The Times of India* 2021) (“44%
    Engineering Students Want to Be Taught in Mother Tongue, Tamil Tops
    List: AICTE Survey” n.d.)

### [3. Profession](#table-of-contents)





### [4. Healthcare](#table-of-contents)
    
## Problem:

**Ineffective diagnosis of symptoms which leads to villagers taking
longer to get the right treatment leading to loss of their precious time
and money.**

## Solution:

Products like digital BP measurer, pulse-oximeter and thermometer should
be readily available at local village medical centers so that villagers
should be precisely able to know about symptoms they are suffering for
better treatment. On an average, a digital BP machine costs Rs.900, a
pulse-oximeter costs Rs.750 and a thermometer(digital) costs Rs.150.
Government of India has granted Rs.8454 crores for improving healthcare
facilities in rural India which means that every village has been
granted about Rs.22 Lakhs on an average, hence these instruments can be
easily afforded by the health centers. 

## Problem:

**Diseases such as Tuberculosis ,whooping cough, respiratory infections,
pneumonia are highly contagious and infectious which may become severe
and cause of death for rural people especially for pregnant ladies and
infants.**

## Solution: 

Seminars should be conducted online on smartphones provided to poor
rural people under government schemes to make villagers aware of the
importance of water purification and should be taught scientific methods
to purify water using household equipment. Science tested Techniques
like filtration, sedimentation, Solar disinfection, Slow sand
filtration, Upflow gravel filter etc should be taught and necessary
equipment should be provided to them.

## Problem:

**Villages don’t have enough doctors and hospitals.**

## Solution:

Remote access or virtual consultations is the need of the hour in
villages. Villagers should be made aware about the online medical
consultation. Government should make an android application and website
for providing free medical consultation to people of rural India  or
villagers should be provided a healthcare scheme under a government
scheme so that they can cover expenses of the virtual consultation
platforms like practo and apollo 24/7.

## Problem:

**People try to self-medicate by using home remedies or witchcraft
(black magic), which might actually worsen their health.**

## Solution:

People should be educated on the benefits of receiving professional
medical care rather than attempting to self-treat or refer to
witchcraft. Various virtual seminars, some animated series and online
advertisements should be promoted on the Aarogya setu app or on
entertainment platforms. The government should introduce virtual
consultation platforms as they would save both time and money for the
person. Health-related start-ups should be encouraged by the government
as well. In remote regions, they can establish a platform that combines
everything from online consultations to the purchase of medication to
the scheduling of health checkups.

## Problem:

**Lack of advisory to the doctor and maintenance of reports.**

## Solution:

Integrating digital information to improve health care efficiency and
accessibility. At any time, a doctor can turn to a support system for
his clinical decision, which will aid him in making the right choice.
When it comes to electronic health records (EHRs), patients no longer
have to take them around with them. Additional to that, the adoption of
digital prescriptions is expected to eliminate prescription errors.

## Problem:

**Unavailability of Medicinal Drugs in Rural areas**

## Solution: 

Government should establish some type of partnership with transport
agencies like uber, and with individual transport vehicle workers like
antoes, to make new apps available to rural areas, through which we can
place an order for medicines we need.

## Problem:

**Less than 10 percent of the rural population uses toilets and have a
lack of sanitary conditions.**

## Solution:

Villagers firstly should be educated about how to maintain good hygiene
and what are the benefits of it. It can be done through interactive
videos and online sessions directly on their mobile phones or through
community events organized by various NGOs and govt. organizations.
Other than that, the government should deploy mobile apps which can be
used by villagers to inform the government about bad conditions of
toilets and other hygiene facilities in their village and then the
government can use this information to take needful actions.
