### [1. Unemployment](#table-of-contents)



#### Guidance/Awareness:
-	Awareness through posters for educated people. Posters can either be attached to any famous place in the village or could be circulated in a newspaper.
-	To reach uneducated ones, we need a medium like their school/college-going children. Now, these children could be targeted either from social media apps like Youtube/ Facebook which are most common, or can be informed via schools/colleges. A group of people working for the improvement of the village could also be used. There might be some meets/fairs of whole villages many times, so this gathering of people may be used for communication.
-	On various occasions and festivals, women gather. So we can educate a few of them and communication to all others could also be possible 
-	Circulating information through advertising and skill enhancement workshops through local channels as most of the middle-class people watch TV's than mobiles
Education : 
-	Farmers could be made aware of the best fertilizers and pesticides in the market either via related shops or via radio 
-	They could be given training on some extra activities they can do for part-time income like poultry farming, cattle farming and the products that could be made with this
-	Educating them about various recently made automated machines and tools and training them about how to use them

#### SSI (Unemployment)
##### The ways to tackle the problem of unemployment in rural areas with the aid of small scale/housing industries are:
-   Small scale industries like Dal Mills in a village that have high production of lentils as are the ones in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, handmade cotton bags in the villages that have high production of cotton as are the ones in Punjab and Haryana can be set up in rural areas to provide employment opportunities. Small scale industries priorly comprise labor-intensive works which create a vast level of employment opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workers. 
-   The practice of farming should also be diversified to other fields like horticulture, animal rearing, and pisciculture depending upon the village’s geographical location. Since farming comprises of seasonal working in the fields, these diversifications can act as a secondary source of income and work for the farmers.  
-   With the medium of financial aid which can be either provided by government-funded schemes, banks, or any other mode, cottage industries can be set up by the people of rural areas at their homes creating employment opportunities for themselves and, for other unemployed people in the village.

#### Small Scale Industries 
- Two of the major factors that are hindrances in the development of small-scale industries are- shrinking local markets and low density.
-  Small- scale industries should be made aware to work with the government to improve ICT coordination, resulting in its development.
- One way of improving productivity in small-scale industries is by upskilling the labor force which can be done by: job rotation, peer mentoring, learning, development, etc.

#### Temporary Unemployment
- A large chunk of people in villages are farmers. Due to the seasonal nature of their work, most of which is during March-June and October-December, they are jobless in the other months. This creates a situation of temporary unemployment.
- To solve this issue, we can create programs that will offer people a job whenever they want while working in their fields in the seasonal months. One of such programs is ‘MGNREGA: Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act”. It is a 100-day work program introduced by the Indian Government in rural areas with a motive to guarantee the ‘right to work’ to all people. Around 13.28 crore workers have been employed using this scheme in 2020-21.



### [2. Education](#table-of-contents)

To improve education quality in a village we are suggesting the
following solutions.

-   **Providing free Internet connection with smartphones:**

    Since there is a lack of high-quality education in villages
    free internet connection can be provided under a scheme funded by the government or a benefactor.
    Using smartphones students can learn from teachers across the whole nation remotely.
    There are many platforms like Udemy, Coursera and Youtube that
    provides education with good teachers across the world. As per a
    recent survey done by ASER, 26.1% of rural families don’t have
    access to smartphones at home.(“27.9% Rural Households Bought
    Smartphone for Kids’ Studies Amid Pandemic: Survey” 2021)

    Smartphones should be configured in such a way that they can only be used
    for educational purposes, this will prevent misuse of smartphones.

-   **Providing access to paid courses on the internet:**

    As most of the structured learning resources are paid on the
    internet. So, we can provide access to those paid courses at a
    subsidised rate so that they can afford it. They can acquire an
    organised, high-quality education through these paid classes,
    similar to what they would get at a premium school. This will have a
    great impact on the future of a student studying in a village with
    limited access to such premium institutions. Students from villages
    will also be able to compete with a student studying in the urban
    area having access to quality education.

-   **Linking Individuals:**

    We can link various subject experts or students good at subjects
    with village students. The village students can’t have access to
    tuition or coaching facilities, so we can provide them with this
    help with students( like NSS) or various NGOs can be linked to it.
    In this way we can make a platform for villagers so that they can
    get access to such help.

-   **Encouraging Ed tech sector:**

    The government needs to encourage the Ed tech sector to provide
    services to students from rural areas as well. Clearly more needs to
    be done by the private sector such as making content available in
    regional languages, making services targeted towards the
    underprivileged etc. This could be done by providing tax benefits
    and government funding.

-   **Modern Education Centre:**

    Modern Education centres can be set up by Governments/Private
    Institutions to provide, where classes of different fields of expert
    teachers can be streamed live for mass students. Students, This
    facility can be used as schools or coaching for the various fields
    to get world-class teaching from the best teachers around the world.

-   **Better translation software for regional languages :**

    74 percent of children in India study in their mother tongue and
    this number is even higher in rural areas. Moreover, 44 percent of
    engineering students want to be taught in their mother tongue. This
    shows most students prefer to learn and are more comfortable in
    their mother tongue. However, most educational content - books,
    articles, videos, research papers - are in English. Furthermore,
    these increase and change at such a fast rate that it is impossible
    to manually translate all the content. Hence, better AI and NLP
    software will need to be developed. Over the last few years, OpenAI
    has made huge strides to make models with performance matching human
    language skills (GPT2 and more recently GPT3). Work will need to be
    done to use this model in regional language translation contexts and
    develop applications to do so.(*The Times of India* 2021) (“44%
    Engineering Students Want to Be Taught in Mother Tongue, Tamil Tops
    List: AICTE Survey” n.d.)
    
    Cost:  
    Time: 1 year

    Operational cost = 2C  
    Computational cost = 2C  
    Total: 10C  


### [3. Profession](#table-of-contents)


#### AGRICULTURE

 Agri App provides the  following services
- Rent   
- Information (Weather, yield)    
- IoT solution
     
##### 1. Renting farming equipment:
Buying the equipment wouldn’t be the most intelligent choice in today’s time since technology is revolutionizing like a flash and one wouldn’t want to be stuck up with conventional methods and techniques while others profit off of the new ones. In the present climate, if someone is a machinery/equipment hoarder, he is allowing money to slip away from the grip of his own hands which isn’t the most desirable situation to be in.

  

##### Why renting farming equipment is better than buying them?

  

1. An ideal alternative to avoid capital investment in farm machinery

2. Reduce input costs and increase productivity

3. Access to high-quality services with mechanized equipment for all farming needs

4. Choose from a wide range of specialized equipment for each application

5. A young or beginning farmer may look at leasing equipment as a means to free up a leverage ratio to allow equity to be used to purchase land someday.

  
  

##### Equipment specifications:

 We will make an app/website on which farmers can easily get their required tools according to their needs.
1. farm equipment items like augers and conveyors for moving grains and seeds,
2. field prep items like field discs
3. field tillage equipment items like harrows, rock pickers, landscapers, dozers, and land rollers
4. pasture maintenance items like pasture aerators and pasture plows.

  
  
  

##### Hiring and sale/purchase of farm machinery

Farm machinery is one of the crucial factors for improving the quality and quantity of yield. Farmers can save money on operational costs, boost revenues and grow more crops with less work by choosing the right farm machinery, but for choosing the right farm machinery a big investment may be needed which every farmer can’t afford, and it may not be viable and efficient. To make it feasible following solution can be implemented:

-   Collectively purchasing farm machinery can bring out efficient use of the tool resulting in saving money and energy. A group of farmers can collectively buy one or more machinery instead of buying individually which they can lend also to support other farmers.
    
-   An app facilitating farmers to hire farm machinery on rental basis, facility of exchanging tools, buying and selling of farm machinery. It helps progressive farmers who are willing to provide their agricultural machinery and equipment on a rental basis to increase their income by making optimum utilization of available tools and machinery in custom hiring centers. It also creates jobs in transportation for delivering hired machinery. A multilingual and easy-to-use app or helpline can help small and marginal farmers by using farm implements on competitive hiring rates and timely availability.
   

  
  

##### 2. Information(Weather, Yield)
Weather forecasting for precipitation and temperature levels, alongside historical data, is critical for effective agricultural plans. However, open-access public sources that use distant meteorological stations provide less accurate weather forecasts.

Using renowned weather data providing platforms like IBM, Our application can provide hyperlocal weather analytics solutions that predict local weather conditions. This will provide farmers with granular level information required for planning and thus significantly reduce forecasting errors.

  

We can combine high-resolution earth observations and data from low-cost weather sensors to provide accurate weather and hyperlocal weather data.

 
-  Based on the rainfall patterns our application can also predict localized rainfall and provide smart irrigation notifications to the farmers thereby allowing farmers to streamline farm planning, operations, and water management.

Our application can provide important pest identification and predictions using weather conditions, cropping time, location for each crop on one to one basis. for the farmers.

  

Additionally, our application can provide free of cost consultants as well as paid farm inspectors and supervisors to guide the farmers.

  

##### 3. IoT solutions

AI-based solutions for improving agricultural yield:

1.  Soil and crop monitoring - we can analyze growth patterns of crops using in-ground sensor data on moisture, fertilizer, and natural nutrient levels. This can help in identifying diseases in plants early.
    
2.  Pest management - Agricultural teams can use AI to predict and identify pest infestations before they occur, using infrared camera data from drones along with sensors on fields that can monitor plants' relative health levels. An optimal mix of biodegradable pesticides can be used in the most affected areas, thereby also decreasing the amount of pesticide required.
    
3.  AI and machine learning-based smart tractors and ag robots - It becomes extremely hard for large-scale agricultural businesses to hire enough workers and at the same time be profitable. Large-scale farmers can use preprogrammed robots to distribute fertilizers on each row of crops to bring down the operating costs and also improve the yield.


#### FISHING

The fishing sector is one of the primary sectors of the Indian economy. In recent years, there have been many technological advancements in this sector. Due to this, the industry has seen increasing growth in the food supply, better and bigger yields, increased nutritional level and new job opportunities. But most of these technological developments are limited to significant fish farming firms/enterprises when they could also benefit the rural population. Some of the possible and affordable solutions that could help the people in GRAMIN India involved in this sector are:

- **Effective monitoring devices:** The primary requirement of the fishing sector is the improvement in the monitoring devices, be it better equipment for navigation or weather monitoring, prediction of better fishing locations or monitoring dissolved oxygen and pH levels. Many of these requirements can be met by intelligent sensor-based IoT devices that provide real-time information to the fish farmers about all such necessary data [see 3]. Such devices can be remotely controlled and could be operated on the surface or underwater. Similar automated solutions can help the fisherman identify better fishing locations and monitor the weather conditions more effectively.
    

- **Biofloc Technology:** Fish farming in rural settings is primarily dependent on natural resources like the availability and productivity of nearby water bodies and other environmental conditions. This dependence on natural resources can be eliminated by setting up artificial fish farming tanks that utilize Biofloc. Biofloc is a symbiotic water process involving confined aquatic animals, heterotrophic bacteria, and other microbial species. It is mainly used in sun-exposed tanks with low or no water exchange. In Biofloc technology, animal feaces are transformed back into nutritious feed, which helps enhance water quality and prevents diseases. Biofloc technology is widely used in shrimp farming. Such systems help rural people gain food security and nutrition security, thereby increasing their financial status and standard of living. An example of how Biofloc technology helped people in rural areas can be seen from this story [see 4]

#### DAILY WAGE

We can create an app which will provide work on a daily basis. The app has the following features:

- The app will work at district level (which include at least 10 villages) and it's interface will be simple and audio is also added which will make it easy to use.

- The app will have two profiles: 1. Workers 2. Job providers

- Workers can create an account with name, contact no. & skills they have(by default set to labourer).

- The worker can select the district in which he/she wants to work.

- Job providers will give the description of job for which the 'n' number of persons needed or some specific skilled-person needed(who knows carpentry, construction work, etc)

- The job description will also have location and contact details.

- This app will also provide what are the recommended daily wages for skilled and unskilled workers.

---
    
#### LOGISTICS

A better logistics system bring greater efficiency in bringing , storing and distribution of goods. In context of villages, about 65% of the population of the country lives in villages And it mainly comprises of agricultural industry and artisan industry.

  

Traditional technical solutions to improve logistics are

Better infrastructure , to travel from villages to cities and better storage + a robust distribution system.

  

Some system solutions , such as improving storage capacity and quality of rural stores and department stores to develop a more robust distribution and storage centre
  

Making a large storage and distribution centre for a few cluster of villages , through which material reaching time decreases a lot to reach individual villages , and the cost of running a single large modern storage and distribution centre will be less than operating many such centres.

  

Village bargaining as a whole so bargaining power can be increased.

  
  

##### Technical solutions

  

Agricultural logistics

Farmers have to bring their produce to APMC Mandis.

Since there are many small farmers they have to rely on big farmers and middlemen for transportation, many times being paid much lower than market rate.

An app based logistical system which has levels of collection centres from village, to cluster of village to district , where a farmer can book us for transportation at any time thus saving his storage cost .

Similarly distribution of seeds, fertilisers etc can be facilitated through apps.

In States where selling is allowed outside of APMC also a whole state level logistical app system directly connecting to wholesalers and supermarkets can be facilitated.

  
  

Artisan logistics

App based logistical solutions can be made. Where App company controls display as well as transportation of your artistic goods.

  

Retail logistics

Integration of e-commerce giants with villages , by using local shops and outlets as distribution centres and storage centres.

  

Integration of wholesales and mid term industries , directly with local retail , and local retails with each other , with an app which arranges price ,minimum procurement quantity etc etc.

So that retailers can compare prices of all wholesales including logistical costs and choose from many wholesalers and industries , rather than relying on few.

Integration of local retailers with an app, where what material is available on them , will help us find it easily whether a good is present with them or not.

In between logistics being controlled by the app company , to streamline flow and increase efficiency.

  

Money and logistics

Role of credit and lending is crucial in maintaining a good logistics system.

Much of the lending and credit is done in cash and record is generally kept , maintained by individuals or unorganised groups ( like truck owner , wholesaler , farmer , individual shop owner ) and credit is raised or given generally on personal respect.

This system can be organised , where we use a central messaging and record keeping system to track how much credit is given to whom or how much money is lent to whom .

Instead of relying on personal guarantee and respect of an individual system such as credit score , loan payment cycle of an individual , his or her profit should be maintained by an app company , which also recommends how much credit can be given with reasonable safety to a particular individual or particular group of individuals.





### [4. Healthcare](#table-of-contents)
    
## Problem:

**Ineffective diagnosis of symptoms which leads to villagers taking
longer to get the right treatment leading to loss of their precious time
and money.**

## Solution:

Products like digital BP measurer, pulse-oximeter and thermometer should
be readily available at local village medical centers so that villagers
should be precisely able to know about symptoms they are suffering for
better treatment. On an average, a digital BP machine costs Rs.900, a
pulse-oximeter costs Rs.750 and a thermometer(digital) costs Rs.150.
Government of India has granted Rs.8454 crores for improving healthcare
facilities in rural India which means that every village has been
granted about Rs.22 Lakhs on an average, hence these instruments can be
easily afforded by the health centers. 

## Problem:

**Diseases such as Tuberculosis ,whooping cough, respiratory infections,
pneumonia are highly contagious and infectious which may become severe
and cause of death for rural people especially for pregnant ladies and
infants.**

## Solution: 

Seminars should be conducted online on smartphones provided to poor
rural people under government schemes to make villagers aware of the
importance of water purification and should be taught scientific methods
to purify water using household equipment. Science tested Techniques
like filtration, sedimentation, Solar disinfection, Slow sand
filtration, Upflow gravel filter etc should be taught and necessary
equipment should be provided to them.

## Problem:

**Villages don’t have enough doctors and hospitals.**

## Solution:

Remote access or virtual consultations is the need of the hour in
villages. Villagers should be made aware about the online medical
consultation. Government should make an android application and website
for providing free medical consultation to people of rural India  or
villagers should be provided a healthcare scheme under a government
scheme so that they can cover expenses of the virtual consultation
platforms like practo and apollo 24/7.

## Problem:

**People try to self-medicate by using home remedies or witchcraft
(black magic), which might actually worsen their health.**

## Solution:

People should be educated on the benefits of receiving professional
medical care rather than attempting to self-treat or refer to
witchcraft. Various virtual seminars, some animated series and online
advertisements should be promoted on the Aarogya setu app or on
entertainment platforms. The government should introduce virtual
consultation platforms as they would save both time and money for the
person. Health-related start-ups should be encouraged by the government
as well. In remote regions, they can establish a platform that combines
everything from online consultations to the purchase of medication to
the scheduling of health checkups.

## Problem:

**Lack of advisory to the doctor and maintenance of reports.**

## Solution:

Integrating digital information to improve health care efficiency and
accessibility. At any time, a doctor can turn to a support system for
his clinical decision, which will aid him in making the right choice.
When it comes to electronic health records (EHRs), patients no longer
have to take them around with them. Additional to that, the adoption of
digital prescriptions is expected to eliminate prescription errors.

## Problem:

**Unavailability of Medicinal Drugs in Rural areas**

## Solution: 

Government should establish some type of partnership with transport
agencies like uber, and with individual transport vehicle workers like
antoes, to make new apps available to rural areas, through which we can
place an order for medicines we need.

## Problem:

**Less than 10 percent of the rural population uses toilets and have a
lack of sanitary conditions.**

## Solution:

Villagers firstly should be educated about how to maintain good hygiene
and what are the benefits of it. It can be done through interactive
videos and online sessions directly on their mobile phones or through
community events organized by various NGOs and govt. organizations.
Other than that, the government should deploy mobile apps which can be
used by villagers to inform the government about bad conditions of
toilets and other hygiene facilities in their village and then the
government can use this information to take needful actions.


### [5. Women](#table-of-contents)

#### Sanitation

Giving women access to clean and safe bathrooms is India's most significant sanitation concern. This is a particularly serious problem in rural areas. As a result, in order to achieve gender equality, all people must have access to adequate bathrooms.

*Government Policies*:

In 2014, the Swachh Bharat Mission was established with the goal of achieving a "clean India." SBM's goals were to eliminate open defecation and transform unsanitary toilets into sanitary toilets (pour-flush ones). It also attempted to execute adequate solid waste collection and processing, as well as create sanitation awareness in order to influence people's attitudes toward good sanitation practices.

Budget allocations, World Bank help, CSR, and the 'Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan' and 'Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan' were all used to fund SBM. The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, the Ministry of Rural Development, and the States all contributed funds to the construction of nine core toilets.

SBM has had a substantial influence. From 550 million at the commencement of the initiative, the number of persons defecating in the open has dropped to barely 50 million. Over 9 million basic toilets have been constructed, and according to the National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey, 96.5 percent of rural Indian families use the toilet when it is available. According to the WHO, Swachh Bharat would save 300,000 lives by 2019 and 150,000 lives yearly after that.

Despite its enormous success, however, SBM is not without its flaws. The construction of washrooms was overemphasized, and villages were accorded ODF (open defecation free) status based on the quantity of toilets, rather than the eradication of fecal-oral transmitted diseases. There were questions regarding the washrooms' durability and long-term viability. The attitude toward using the newly erected washrooms is also a problem. Despite having access to one, people in rural areas prefer open defecation due to cultural and societal issues. The problem of waste treatment is yet unsolved.

#### Water Supply

Even in these times, the problems faced by rural area in terms of water includes 

- Lack of proper quality and quantity of water for basic needs like drinking, bathing, or cooking. This is due to issues of low income, illiteracy, technology deficient areas. There is no proper supply of water and they need to rely on getting water from a well or some other water body nearby. The method is tiresome and requires storing water in containers in the home for quick use and also the quality of water is not very good. 
    
- Lack of sustained source of drinking water
    Often to get a quick solution to this, people buy bottled water, which is not a long-lasting solution and also leads to the problem of waste disposal disturbing the ecological balance.

- Also, natural calamities liked floods and droughts pose a serious threat to scarcity of water.
    
*Proposed Solution:*

Centralized Water supply with outlets at various points of the village and solar controlled with an inbuilt water purifier for drinking purposes.

#### Healthcare

It's no secret that rural communities in developing countries face distinct challenges from their urban counterparts. Isolation, scarcity of resources, and limited access to essential services such as clean water, education, and health care are all standard.

Over 70% of the population in India lives in rural areas, and there is a significant gender divide, with rural women having lower education, less employment, and higher poverty. 

Rural communities also have limited access to the internet and technological devices, resulting in more isolation. Women are still at a disadvantage in communities where online access is available. A persistent digital gender divide shows that women are 23% less likely than men to use mobile internet.

One of the most challenging problems is the health of pregnant women. Babies are frequently born at home in rural areas, where healthcare can be complicated. One solution can be to start a program in tie-ups with hospitals where we increase the likelihood of pregnant women giving birth with the assistance of a skilled birth attendant. This can be integrated with a digital platform or phones and create a messaging system to track the stage of pregnancy and provide more services even after birth, such as childcare. 

#### Women Employment

Informal rural female workers have the lowest average daily wage of any worker group (Rs.104/day).

However, science and technology can assist in improving their standard of living. Technology can increase crop yields, thereby increasing profits for women farmers, reducing women's domestic and productive work by introducing labor-saving technologies, and boosting women's participation in the rural labor market through improved communications. ICT has emerged as a powerful tool and can help reduce women's isolation, increase their bargaining power, and improve their ability to pool skills. We can establish community-learning centers in villages that use innovations like satellite and telecommunication to provide agricultural extension, soil and pest analysis, and health diagnostic expertise to women even in remote rural areas. It may also include libraries with innovative technology-sharing arrangements that enable poor women to access technologies that would otherwise be inaccessible to them. Female leaders from various villages also assist in identifying village demand for improved certified seeds and other technologies, which are then purchased wholesale and delivered to women farmers in need.  

#### Financial Independence

We have seen that many of the women in rural areas are dependent on their male counterparts financially. One of the main reasons is the lack of financial literacy. Women in rural areas have very limited access to information on how to engage with the evolving financial space, especially when it is online and digital. Women also have limited literacy, constrained mobility, and access to public spaces.

Some National-level efforts to enhance financial literacy have been focused on setting up Financial Literacy and Counselling Centres by leading banks of a district or state. Their main objective is to improve the financial education of rural women who are dependent on their male counterparts financially and improve the attitude of male members towards females in their households making household financial decisions.

Each woman received an average of 30 hours of training over 15-18 months. The trainers were chosen from among the community and the training sessions were followed by financial education included with exposure visits to ATMs and banks, which helped the participants link with financial products and services of their choice.

The program revealed several benefits for women. The training and exposure visits raised their confidence in dealing with financial institutions and enabled them to play a greater role in household financial decision-making, and resulted in a positive change in the attitude of male members who attended the sessions. This solution can be enhanced further and implemented in a more advanced way considering its limitations to improve the financial independence of women in rural areas.
