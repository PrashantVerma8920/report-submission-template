### [Abstract](#table-of-contents)



### [1. Unemployment](#table-of-contents)




### [2. Education](#table-of-contents)

To improve education quality in a village we are suggesting the
following solutions.

-   **Providing free Internet connection with smartphones:**

    Since there is a lack of high-quality education in villages. So we
    can provide free internet connection under some government scheme.
    Using smartphones they can learn from the national level teachers.
    There are many platforms like Udemy, Coursera and Youtube that
    provides education with good teachers across the world. As per a
    recent survey done by ASER, 26.1% of rural families don’t have
    access to smartphones at home.(“27.9% Rural Households Bought
    Smartphone for Kids’ Studies Amid Pandemic: Survey” 2021)

    Smartphones should be configured in such a way that they can only be
    for educational purposes this will prevent misuse of smartphones.

-   **Providing access to paid courses on the internet:**

    As most of the structured learning resources are paid on the
    internet. So, we can provide access to those paid courses at a
    subsidised rate so that they can afford it. They can acquire an
    organised, high-quality education through these paid classes,
    similar to what they would get at a premium school. This will have a
    great impact on the future of a student studying in a village with
    limited access to such premium institutions. Students from villages
    will also be able to compete with a student studying in the urban
    area having access to quality education.

-   **Linking Individuals:**

    We can link various subject experts or students good at subjects
    with village students. The village students can’t have access to
    tuition or coaching facilities, so we can provide them with this
    help with students( like NSS) or various NGOs can be linked to it.
    In this way we can make a platform for villagers so that they can
    get access to such help.

-   **Encouraging Ed tech sector:**

    The government needs to encourage the Ed tech sector to provide
    services to students from rural areas as well. Clearly more needs to
    be done by the private sector such as making content available in
    regional languages, making services targeted towards the
    underprivileged etc. This could be done by providing tax benefits
    and government funding.

-   **Modern Education Centre:**

    Modern Education centres can be set up by Governments/Private
    Institutions to provide, where classes of different fields of expert
    teachers can be streamed live for mass students. Students, This
    facility can be used as schools or coaching for the various fields
    to get world-class teaching from the best teachers around the world.

-   **Better translation software for regional languages :**

    74 percent of children in India study in their mother tongue and
    this number is even higher in rural areas. Moreover, 44 percent of
    engineering students want to be taught in their mother tongue. This
    shows most students prefer to learn and are more comfortable in
    their mother tongue. However, most educational content - books,
    articles, videos, research papers - are in English. Furthermore,
    these increase and change at such a fast rate that it is impossible
    to manually translate all the content. Hence, better AI and NLP
    software will need to be developed. Over the last few years, OpenAI
    has made huge strides to make models with performance matching human
    language skills (GPT2 and more recently GPT3). Work will need to be
    done to use this model in regional language translation contexts and
    develop applications to do so.(*The Times of India* 2021) (“44%
    Engineering Students Want to Be Taught in Mother Tongue, Tamil Tops
    List: AICTE Survey” n.d.)
