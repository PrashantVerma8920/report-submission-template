##### Requirements

**Geographical requirements**


![Wind Power Potential Map.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17D9xaRuItm_8S8facI4KprtHKPHFUbi8/view?usp=sharing)

Though wind power is a very clean source of energy, it is not so easy to harness. To generate a good amount of electricity using wind power, one needs an average annual wind speed of atleast more than 5m/s. The above shown wind power potential map explains how the wind power potential is distributed across India? The states with the highest potential are Gujrat, J&K and Tamil Nadu where the average annual wind speed is above 5.6m/s. We can also see that in general, the potential is a lot higher in states along the western coast. 

**Other basic requirements**

- The wind turbine should be able to generate a power output to meet the basic energy requirements of a regular household like charging mobile phones and lighting small appliances.
- An inverter should be used to convert the erratic AC produced by the turbine into DC for energy storage and then back to smoother AC for direct use in the household.
- Energy storage grid should not be far away from the wind turbine to avoid power loss due to wire resistance.
- Turbine blades to be made of light materials like carbon fibre or fibre glass, or can also be 3D printed.
- Length of pole should be high enough to avoid any obstacles, such as trees, houses, in the surrounding and provide an uninterrupted stream flow.
- The mechanical parts of the turbine, for example, the gear box (used for increasing rpm) will be machined from high tensile steel to ensure wear resistance.

**Cost Analysis**

 | Part                                     | Cost    |
 |:----------------------------------------:|:-------:|
 | Nacelle                                  | ₹1,000  |
 | Rotor (Blades + Hub)                     | ₹3,000  |
 | Generator                                | ₹12,000 |
 | Tower                                    | ₹6,000  |
 | Other misc items like gearbox, wind vane, bolts, etc. | ₹2,000  |
 | **Total**                                | ₹24,000 |
    
  The above cost just entails the amount to get all the necessary parts to make the wind turbine excluding the labour cost. So, if we include the man-power needed to get it assembled and build the different parts, the turbine's entire prototype cost is projected to be ₹30,000. This is based on the best-case scenario quote, which excludes any remachining or unforeseen failures. Since there is the possibility of human mistake, accommodations must be taken to guarantee that an accurate situation is presented. As a result, some extra financing should be included to the cost estimate to cover for unanticipated losses.  Therefore, the net cost to make the wind turbine up and running will come about ₹34,000.



##### Diagrams and Working

Wind turbine designs involves looking over a lot of environmental and mechanical aspects for an efficient and sturdy electrical energy generation system. In our design, we have tried to considered a lot of these factors and have tried to keep the as real as possible. The actual contruction of the wind turbine is a secondary objective and has been taken into optimum consideration during the design phase. But as the design of the wind turbine discussed below is based on existing technology investigated in the literature review and research process it's a little difficult to get the exact specifications ready for construction just by working on the design remotely, therfore, depending upon the resources available and the feasibility of the model the design discussed below can be altered.

Below is the CAD model of the small wind turbine along with brief desciption of some components:

- The blades and rotor are the parts of the turbine that interact with the wind and are designed to enhance efficiency. Blades are made of light materials with good wear and tear resistance, in this design we have used fibre-reinforced plastic. And to prevent the material from ageing, a layer of coloured gel is applied to the blade and rotor's external surface.

- The horizontal axis small wind turbine (HAWT) is usually placed on a pole, preferably higher than 10 m, to lessen the impact of turbulent, sheared winds forming in close proximity to the ground. But since it is a small wind turbine with relatively less weight and comparably lower power output, the turbine can be put on a variety of existing structures, including roof tops, and rain water tanks, as long as it keeps the turbine's blades clear of the ground and in a continuous stream tube. Still, in our design we have taken a tubular steel pole for placing the wind turbine above obstacles in urban areas. This can be omitted depending on the place where you want to install the turbine and reduce the installation cost.

After the completion of the mechanical design of the wind turbine, the next step is to look after the electrical connections for enregy storage and usage. The block diagram shown below shows the big picture of the all electrical connections necessary to get the wind turbine ready for electricity generation and daily household usage. More details about the connections is taken up in detail by the energy stoarge team ahead.
