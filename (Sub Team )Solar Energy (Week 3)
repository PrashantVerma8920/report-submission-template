##### Requirements

**Geographical requirements**

The location of that the house should be such that bright sunlight falls on the roof for significant amount of time.

**Requirements from the house**

 The roof top must contain at-least 200 sq. ft area well enough exposed to direct sunlight to generate 2.5kW of power.

##### Specifications

**Components**

(1) Bluebird 395 Watt Solar Panels 
-  Solar Panels designed with high efficiency A+ Grade 5BB Cell Technology. 
-  Only positive power tolerance. Better than conventional mono-crystalline solar panel 
-  Built with Heavy-duty silver anodized aluminum frame with Pre-drilled holes on the back of the panel for easy & fast Installation 
-  PID, Salt mist & ammonia corrosion resistant cells and encapsulant 
- Attached with IP68 rated Junction box with 3 By Pass Diode, 4mm cable and 2 MC4 connectors 

(2) HAVELLS HRFR PVC 4 sq/mm Yellow 90 m Wire 
- Nominal Area of Conductor: 4 sq/mm 
-  Current Carrying Capacity: 42 A 
- Voltage Grade: 1100 V 
- Length: 90 m 
- Insulation Thickness: 0.8 mm 

(3) Solar Panel Mounting Structure Set for 2 Solar Panel (6 Channel, 4 End Clamps, 2 Mid Clamps, 6 Spring Nut M8) 

(4) MBATechmeds Solar Sun Tracker (Single Axis) 

**Power generation **

Assuming house will have bright sunlight for 5 hours daily. The Power output of 6 solar panels monthly(30 days) = 6\*5\*395*30/1000 kWh= 355.5 kWh

We can vary number of solar panels and the bright sunlight available as per the given condition.

**Cost Analysis**

*Installation Cost*

 Cost 6 Bluebird 395 Watt Solar Panels = ₹ 6\*14,250 = ₹ 85,500/- 
 Cost of HAVELLS HRFR PVC 4 sq/mm Yellow 90 m Wire = ₹4,351/- 
 Cost of 3 Solar Panel Mounting Structure = ₹ 3\*2,261= ₹6,783/- 
 Cost of Solar Tracker = ₹6000/- 
 Total Installation cost = ₹85500+₹4,351+₹6783+₹6000 = ₹102634 

*Maintenance Cost*

Negligible Maintenance cost because we have to just clean the solar panels

##### Diagrams and Working

  - So firstly, solar energy falls on the solar panels. We make sure that solar panels are at the best angles for maximum exposure to the sunlight through an \*Active Solar Tracker\*.This device's sensors react with sunlight and angle the solar panels through drivers and motors accordingly. 
 
 - These solar panels are mounted on the roof with the help of mounting structures and they allow them to maintain and change their position according to the position of the sun. 
- These solar panels are made up of solar (or photovoltaic) cells that can be used to generate power via the photovoltaic effect. On the surface of solar panels, these cells are organised in a grid-like arrangement. As a result, it can alternatively be described as a collection of photovoltaic modules put on a supporting framework. A photovoltaic (PV) module is a 610 solar cell packaged and linked assembly.

 - After light strikes these photovoltaic cells they convert that kinetic energy of photons is absorbed by the electrons inside the material and they come out on the surface if this absorbed energy is greater than their work function. 
- These electrons also possess some kinetic energy and this energy can be converted into electric potential energy. This effect is called the photoelectric effect and it is the working principle for these solar panels. 
- This electric current generated is then transferred to the inverter through cables and wires and then it is stored in the batteries. This energy is then first converted to AC current through inverters and then is distributed in the house for usage.
