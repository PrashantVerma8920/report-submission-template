#### [5. Piezoelectricity](#table-of-contents)


**5.1 Requirements**

**5.1.1 Geographical Limitations**

The power output of a particular piezoelectric energy harvester depends upon intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors include the frequency constant of the piezoelectric element, piezoelectric and mechanical properties of the material, and the temperature and stress dependence of the physical properties. Extrinsic factors comprise of the input vibration frequency, acceleration of the base/host structure, and the amplitude of the excitation. By choosing the right material for piezoelectric devices we can significantly reduce the effects of temperature on the performance. 
  
Thus, there are no particular geographical restrictions for building piezoelectric energy harvesters such as piezo-tiles. But in case of piezoelectric windturbines(blade and non-blade), it will have better efficiency in the western part of the country where average windspeed is above 10kmph as well as in hilly areas and near coastal regions.

The energy created by the resonance in the mast is transferred to the disc attached at its bottom and later transferred to the piezoelectric system, where hence electricity is generated.

**5.3 Diagrams and Working**


Below are the CAD models and designs of the proposed piezoelectric energy harvesters with brief description of working model:

**Piezoelectric Tiles**

- <ins>_Working Model:_</ins> When a load is applied to the tile surface it moves in the downward direction. The projections on the tile surface come in contact with the piezo material. The applied force produces stresses inside piezo material which will produce electricity. There is clearance in between the springs and tile surface in order to provide free deflection. The spring is provided for stability as well as protecting the piezo material from getting damaged by an excess load applied. The base plate is fitted inside the frame firmly to provide support to the piezo material while compression. This kinetic energy is converted into electricity. This generated electricity is stored in the form of batteries, to which the rectifier is connected to get a pure dc supply.

**Piezoelectric Wind Turbine**


- <ins>_Working Model:_</ins> The fundamental principle here is to convert the kinetic energy of air into physical-mechanical stress. After this, with the help of a piezoelectric sensor we covert that mechanical pressure into the alternating impulse of charge flow i.e. current. To saddle the active vitality of air, we use a vertical structure which is called the mast. The mast vibrations are converted into vertical stress on the piezoelectric sensors through a metal plate called Disc which is welded at fixed support of the mast. This vertical stress is transferred to another plate on which our whole piezoelectric circuit is placed. Now we have successfully converted the air kinetic energy into the normal stress on piezoelectric sensors. When stress is applied on the piezoelectric sensor i.e. piezoelectric chips they produce a charge which on connecting through wires produces current.

**Piezoelectric Shoes**

- <ins>_Working Model:_</ins> When a person walks, pressure is exerted on the ground and this pressure can be converted into electrical energy and it can be used to power electronic devices. A piezoelectric sensor pad is placed in the shoe. The power that is generated by piezoelectric sensors when a person walks is transferred to the battery using a full-wave bridge rectifier. A diode was soldered to each piezo pad, and a rectifier was soldered to the system before it was connected to the battery.

**5.5 Closure**

1. _Piezoelectric tiles:_ Piezo tiles are usually made of volcanic dust, kaolin, feldspar and PZT and hence are very crystalline in nature.The brittle nature of lead zirconium titanate (PZT) can cause the formation of cracks over time when operating under cyclic loading conditions. Such cracks in the bulk material can reduce performance due to a complex combination of factors. Tiles will work properly for a long time if not broken by any external force without needing any servicing. 

2. _Piezoelectric shoes:_ Piezoelectric materials, whether natural or synthetic, are crystalline in nature. They should last forever, but being very brittle can be damaged if dropped or even if driven at too high power. Such crystals used in electronics should last at least until the contacts touching the crystal faces wear out. Hence it will depend on the durability of shoes. 

      Unfortunately the amount of energy stored during a charging cycle (which took around 4000 steps) was very small and it would take an unrealistic amount of charging cycles to charge a cell phone just by walking alone.  By our calculations, it will take approximately 564,971.78 charging cycles, which amounts to 2,118,644,250 steps, in a best case scenario(when all the piezo plates are contributing). This also means it would take 706,214.75 hours to charge the cell phone.

3. _Piezoelectric Bladeless Windmill:_ Bladeless windmills or Vortex windmills are quite competitive and economically efficient in the small wind market. It has a high energy production factor (The factor obtained represents the unit of energy (kWh) divided by an estimation of investment for a fixed period of time, here 1 year). It also has low installation as well as low maintenance cost as compared to windmill with blades and is self-running and standalone. This is a new alternative and innovative way to harness energy from wind.
