### Abstract 

- We are designing a modular energy generation system, which can be assembled completely or in parts depending on your geographical limitations and cost bearing capabilities.
We have mentioned the requirements needed (geographical/structural/machinery wise etc..) for each portion of the system to be assembled , and the user can choose the model which fits his/her budget after checking their geographical compatibility. 
- For eg:- a user living in rural areas will benefit a lot from biogas based electricity (since there are lots of cowdung cakes around) while a user in urban area may not benefit so much from it but he/she might have better access to solar panels and can bear heavy one time costs.
- Similarly areas with open spaces and strong gusty winds can use wind turbines, whereas areas which are enclosed like malls/complexes etc. might benefit more from peizoelectric tiles(since they attract loads of crowd and has people walking 24/7.)
- Houses which have lot of people willing to exercise can benefit from bicycle powered generation , since there will be more man-power and so on.
- We have in total provided with 8 different ways of electricity generation and a storage and distribution system, the limitation of this system is for those who can't use any of the 8 ways due to geographical boundations or cost unaffordability , although such conditions will be rare considering the variety of methods presented. Nonetheless, this system will cater to most people in varying amounts of effectiveness and feasibility.

- The main idea is to have a modular system comprising of lots of options which can then be customized according to user's preferences. The following report contains all the information that a user needs to make the right choices for his/her customized version of the system. In fact an interactive app can be made where upon entering the geographical details and budget , it will make a suggestion for a system customized for that particular locale. 

- Also in the storage of energy sub section, We have provided with three categories:- **plus tier system**, **base tier system**, **economy tier system**. The user can choose
  according to his/her preferences.

### To Do
- First check the geographical and basic requirements of the system you wish to incorporate in your customized design,
- Then check out if you can bear the one time installation and maintainence costs
- After finalizing the selected systems based on the above two points, select the tier system for energy storage and distribution based on the energy generated in your system and the cost affordability.
- Now,You finally have your own customized system according to your specific needs

#### [1. Wind](#table-of-contents)

**1.1 Requirements**

**1.1.1 Geographical requirements**

Though wind power is a very clean source of energy, it is not so easy to harness. The world map shown below depicts wind energy potential across the world. The regions marked in red have the highest wind power density and the regions marked in blue have the lowest. The measurements have been done in W/m: dark red shows potential over 1300 W/m and light blue shows potential less than 25 W/m. This map can be used to identify ideal regions to harness wind energy across the globe.

<p align = "center">Fig.1 - Wind Power Density Potential ([Ref. wikimedia commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Global_Map_of_Wind_Power_Density_Potential.png))

For an Indian household, to generate a good amount of electricity using wind power, one needs an average annual wind speed of at-least more than 5m/s. The wind power potential map shown below explains how the wind power potential is distributed across India? The states with the highest potential are Gujarat, J&K and Tamil Nadu where the average annual wind speed is above 5.6m/s. We can also see that in general, the potential is a lot higher in states along the western coast.

**1.1.2 Other basic requirements**

- The wind turbine should be able to generate a power output to meet the basic energy requirements of a regular household like charging mobile phones and lighting small appliances.
- An inverter should be used to convert the erratic AC produced by the turbine into DC for energy storage and then back to smoother AC for direct use in the household.
- Energy storage grid should not be far away from the wind turbine to avoid power loss due to wire resistance.
- Turbine blades to be made of light materials like carbon fiber or fiber glass, or can also be 3D printed.
- Length of pole should be high enough to avoid any obstacles, such as trees, houses, in the surrounding and provide an uninterrupted stream flow.
- The mechanical parts of the turbine, for example, the gear box (used for increasing rpm) will be machined from high tensile steel to ensure wear resistance.

**Maintenance cost** 
All practitioners recommend annual maintenance for the small wind turbine, which involves applying grease to bearings, maintaining the leading edge of wind turbine blades and providing a general inspection.  Therefore, a provision of one skilled mechanic at a daily wage of ₹784 is considered for the maintenance of the system.


**1.3 Diagrams and Working**

Wind turbine designs involves looking over a lot of environmental and mechanical aspects for an efficient and sturdy electrical energy generation system. In our design, we have tried to considered a lot of these factors and have tried to keep the as real as possible. The actual construction of the wind turbine is a secondary objective and has been taken into optimum consideration during the design phase. But as the design of the wind turbine discussed below is based on existing technology investigated in the literature review and research process it's a little difficult to get the exact specifications ready for construction just by working on the design remotely, therefore, depending upon the resources available and the feasibility of the model the design discussed below can be altered.

Below is the CAD model of the small wind turbine along with brief description of some components:

- The blades and rotor are the parts of the turbine that interact with the wind and are designed to enhance efficiency. Blades are made of light materials with good wear and tear resistance, in this design we have used fibre-reinforced plastic. And to prevent the material from ageing, a layer of colored gel is applied to the blade and rotor's external surface. 

- The horizontal axis small wind turbine (HAWT) is usually placed on a pole, preferably higher than 10 m, to lessen the impact of turbulent, sheared winds forming in close proximity to the ground. But since it is a small wind turbine with relatively less weight and comparably lower power output, the turbine can be put on a variety of existing structures, including roof tops, and rain water tanks, as long as it keeps the turbine's blades clear of the ground and in a continuous stream tube. Still, in our design we have taken a tubular steel pole for placing the wind turbine above obstacles in urban areas. This can be omitted depending on the place where you want to install the turbine and reduce the installation cost.

After the completion of the mechanical design of the wind turbine, the next step is to look after the electrical connections for energy storage and usage. The block diagram shown below shows the big picture of the all electrical connections necessary to get the wind turbine ready for electricity generation and daily household usage.

**2.1 Requirements**

**2.1.1 Geographical requirements**

Different regions on the globe get different amount of sunlight at different angles. For example, at equator the earth recieves more focused sunlight than on poles where the light spreads over a wide area. The area which receives more focused sunlight can generate more solar energy. Different geographical features also play a role like forest areas or hilly areas which have low solar power avalibilty.

*Maintenance Cost*

Negligible Maintenance cost because we have to just clean the solar panels.


**2.3 Diagrams and Working**

- When solar radiations fall on the solar panels, we make sure that the solar panels are at their best angles for maximum exposure to the sunlight through an \*Active Solar Tracker\*.This device's sensors react with sunlight and angle the solar panels through drivers and motors accordingly. 
- These solar panels are mounted on the roof with the help of mounting structures and they allow them to maintain and change their position according to the position of the sun. 
- These solar panels are made up of solar (or photovoltaic) cells that can be used to generate power via the photovoltaic effect. On the surface of solar panels, these cells are organised in a grid-like arrangement. As a result, it can alternatively be described as a collection of photovoltaic modules put on a supporting framework. A photovoltaic (PV) module is a 610 solar cell packaged and linked assembly.

- After light strikes these photovoltaic cells, the kinetic energy of photons is absorbed by the electrons inside the material and they come out on the surface if this absorbed energy is greater than their work function. 
- These electrons also possess some kinetic energy and this energy can be converted into electric potential energy. This effect is called the photoelectric effect and it is the working principle for these solar panels. 
- This electric current generated is then transferred to the inverter through cables and wires and then it is stored in the batteries. This energy is then first converted to AC current through inverters and then is distributed in the house for usage. 

**2.4 Closure**

The life of this solar grid system is approximately 40-50 years (with 25 years in warranty) with minimal maintainance. The parts we used are listed in the following table with their corresponding warranties:

<div align="center">
	
|Device |Warranty Period|
|-------|---------------|
|Bluebird 395 Watt Solar Panels| 25 Years |
|HAVELLS HRFR PVC 4 sq/mm Yellow wire| 1 Year |
| Solar Panel Mounting Structure Set for 2 Solar Panel | 5 Years |
| MBATechmeds Solar Sun Tracker | 5 Years |
	
</div>

<p align = "center">

This system is designed to fulfill requirements of a household without consuming any commercial power supply. It is a good alternative from commercial power supply as it is generating clean energy with minimal cost. There is only one time high cost for installing the system but after that it provides continuous energy for many years with negledible costing.

#### [3. Mechanical](#table-of-contents) 

**3.1 Requirements**

**3.1.1 Geographical requirements**

System can work under all geographical conditions.

**3.1.2 Basic Requirements**
1. An average fit person (in the age range of 18 years - 45 years) can generate 115W of electricity from pedalling a cycle connected with a dynamo which means we can generate around 460w power for a household with four adults and 230w power for a household with two adults, an elite cyclist can generate upto 300W.
2. Geared DC Motor should be brushless as brushes make the efficiency of motors down to less than 40%,  which is miserable.
    
3. To operate the speed controller, we have to use a servo tester. The servo tester offers a physical dial, dialing which we can increase the speed of rotation of the motor. 

**3.2 Specifications**

**3.2.1 Components**

(1)  *Bicycle*:Here, it is used to rotate the motor using mechanical power, thus producing electricity.

(2) *DC Motor*:It helps in converting the mechanical energy through pedals into rotatory motion (the pedals generate force in the form of torque applied on the motor's shaft) which is then converted into electrical energy.Here, we have to remove the brushes of the geared brushed DC Motor as instead of providing lots of torque, it is not fast enough.

(3) *Lithium Ion Cells*:It is used to power the DC motor controller.Due to the limited space we have to use a pair of high discharge lithium polymer battery packs. Two 11.1v and 5200 mAh batteries required with a peak discharge of 25C which means that these batteries can provide nearly 130 amp of continuous current draw

(4) *Sprocket*:A sprocket or chain wheel is a profiled wheel with teeth that mesh with a chain, track or other perforated or indented material. To drive the rear wheel we need somewhere around 16N-m of torque and so the required speed is 50km/hr. Our sensorless speed controller can handle 22.2v max, so we can get around 350 rpm. With this setup and gear ratio 1:1 we can have the sufficient torque.

(5) *Chain*:It is used to connect rear sprocket to the dc motor to rotate  the motor.

(6) *Buck-Boost converter*:The buck–boost converter is a type of DC-to-DC converter (also known as a chopper) that has an output voltage magnitude that is either greater than or less than the input voltage magnitude. It is used to “step up” the DC voltage.

**3.2.2 Power generation**

Our project has 4 stationary bicycles as we are assuming a household of 4 members.Each stationary cycle when pedaled by an average fit person can generate 115watts of electricity and up to 300 watts when driven by an elite cyclist.
Let us assume that each cycle is rode for 2 hours a day.
Energy generated by all 4 bicycles on an average=115watts* 2hours* 4cycles=920wh=0.92Kwh=0.92units.

**3.2.3 Cost Analysis**

|Buck Boost converter| Rs 3000 |
|Power inverter| Rs 5000|

<figcaption align = "center"><b>Table1 - Total Installation Cost </b></figcaption>  


So, cost for installing 4 bicycle generators: 23000*4=Rs 92,000

*Maintenance Cost* :Negligible maintenance cost

**3.3 Diagrams and Working**

- Here DC motor works as DC generator. It has a flywheel attached to it which increases its moment of inertia meaning even if you stop cycling for a moment, the generator will spin by itself for a couple of seconds.
- The output of the generator is connected to a buck-boost converter, whose output is then fed to a power inverter which is finally driving the load. This is done to regulate the generated voltage to get its full use.
- In this setup, the buck boost converter is driven by a 3-60 v dc always stepping up or down to the input voltage to an exact output voltage of 22.2v dc.
- This 22.2v is then fed to a power inverter which steps up and reshapes it to 230v 50Hz ac.
- After charging the batteries, the inverter is removed and the output of the buck boost converter is directly attached to the two 11.1v batteries connected in series.
- Below is the model for our bicycle electricity generator

<p align = "center">Fig.4.2 - Major rivers of India</b></figcaption>
Waterfalls are also suitable for the feasibility of this system. Any waterfall close to your house with head-height of at least 2m is suitable for this plant.

[List of waterfalls in india](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_waterfalls_in_India_by_height)


Apart from major rivers or waterfalls, If your house is located near by any flowing water river or stored water at height of more than 2m that receives enough water to keep the water body filled throughout the year then this system will be feasible.

- _Land_: The land should be rocky enough so that it bears the pressure by the dam and shouldn’t be swampy.

**4.1.3 Electrical Requirements**

The following are the _electrical requirements_:

- _Generator_: It should be rated for 1*kW* power generation at 500*rpm* with high efficiency and should be water-resistant.

- _Rectifier_: It should be rated for a minimum of 50*V* RMS.

- _Wires_: It should be rated to carry 30*A* of current and of sufficient length.
- _Pipes_: It should be capable to flow 0.03 m<sup>3</sup>/s of water.

**4.2 Specifications**

**4.2.1 Components**

_(1) Turbine_

The water turbine is the heart of any hydro power plant. It consists of a number of metal or plastic blades fitted to a central rotating shaft or plate. Water flowing through the casing strikes the blades of the turbine producing torque and making the shaft rotate thus conversing K.E. for water to M.E.

**4.2.2 Power generation**

The maximum hydropower power output is entirely dependent on how much head and flow is available at the site. The formula for power calculation is derived from the concept of stored potential energy in water at a certain height H(Head Height) and given by the formula:

<p align = "center">
	
Power (P) = m * g * H<sub>net</sub> * η
</p>

Here: m is the mass flow rate(kg/s), g is 9.81m/s<sup>2</sup>, H<sub>net</sub> is the effective height of stored water, η is overall efficiency
Most of the Hydro-Electric systems used for domestic purposes have η about 75%.

**4.3 Diagrams and Working**

As shown in the figure, water stored at high elevation falls on the turbine of generator i.e. converting the potential energy of water to mechanical energy of turbine by rotating it. Now, this mechanical energy of turbine is converted to electrical energy with the help of drives. Now this pulsating alternating current is passed through transformers for transmitting to distant use places and finally it passes through ac/dc converters to make it usable at required places.

This figure shows a typical model for mini hyrdro-electric plant. The height of the dam from the turbine should be more than 2m.

#### [5. Piezoelectricity](#table-of-contents)


**5.1 Requirements**

**5.1.1 Geographical Limitations**

The power output of a particular piezoelectric energy harvester depends upon intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors include the frequency constant of the piezoelectric element, piezoelectric and mechanical properties of the material, and the temperature and stress dependence of the physical properties. Extrinsic factors comprise of the input vibration frequency, acceleration of the base/host structure, and the amplitude of the excitation. By choosing the right material for piezoelectric devices we can significantly reduce the effects of temperature on the performance. 
  
Thus, there are no particular geographical restrictions for building piezoelectric energy harvesters such as piezo-tiles. But in case of piezoelectric windturbines(blade and non-blade), it will have better efficiency in the western part of the country where average windspeed is above 10kmph as well as in hilly areas and near coastal regions.

**5.3 Diagrams and Working**


Below are the CAD models and designs of the proposed piezoelectric energy harvesters with brief description of working model:

**Piezoelectric Tiles**

- <ins>_Working Model:_</ins> When a load is applied to the tile surface it moves in the downward direction. The projections on the tile surface come in contact with the piezo material. The applied force produces stresses inside piezo material which will produce electricity. There is clearance in between the springs and tile surface in order to provide free deflection. The spring is provided for stability as well as protecting the piezo material from getting damaged by an excess load applied. The base plate is fitted inside the frame firmly to provide support to the piezo material while compression. This kinetic energy is converted into electricity. This generated electricity is stored in the form of batteries, to which the rectifier is connected to get a pure dc supply.

 </p>


**Piezoelectric Wind Turbine**


- <ins>_Working Model:_</ins> The fundamental principle here is to convert the kinetic energy of air into physical-mechanical stress. After this, with the help of a piezoelectric sensor we covert that mechanical pressure into the alternating impulse of charge flow i.e. current. To saddle the active vitality of air, we use a vertical structure which is called the mast. The mast vibrations are converted into vertical stress on the piezoelectric sensors through a metal plate called Disc which is welded at fixed support of the mast. This vertical stress is transferred to another plate on which our whole piezoelectric circuit is placed. Now we have successfully converted the air kinetic energy into the normal stress on piezoelectric sensors. When stress is applied on the piezoelectric sensor i.e. piezoelectric chips they produce a charge which on connecting through wires produces current.

A piezoelectric sensor pad is placed in the shoe. The power that is generated by piezoelectric sensors when a person walks is transferred to the battery using a full-wave bridge rectifier. A diode was soldered to each piezo pad, and a rectifier was soldered to the system before it was connected to the battery.

**5.5 Closure**

1. _Piezoelectric tiles:_ Piezo tiles are usually made of volcanic dust, kaolin, feldspar and PZT and hence are very crystalline in nature.The brittle nature of lead zirconium titanate (PZT) can cause the formation of cracks over time when operating under cyclic loading conditions. Such cracks in the bulk material can reduce performance due to a complex combination of factors. Tiles will work properly for a long time if not broken by any external force without needing any servicing. 

2. _Piezoelectric shoes:_ Piezoelectric materials, whether natural or synthetic, are crystalline in nature. They should last forever, but being very brittle can be damaged if dropped or even if driven at too high power. Such crystals used in electronics should last at least until the contacts touching the crystal faces wear out. Hence it will depend on the durability of shoes. 

      Unfortunately the amount of energy stored during a charging cycle (which took around 4000 steps) was very small and it would take an unrealistic amount of charging cycles to charge a cell phone just by walking alone.  By our calculations, it will take approximately 564,971.78 charging cycles, which amounts to 2,118,644,250 steps, in a best case scenario(when all the piezo plates are contributing). This also means it would take 706,214.75 hours to charge the cell phone.

- The topside of the aluminum plate is painted black paint to improve heat absorption.
- Fresnel lens is used for concentrating more sunlight on aluminum sheet.
- Next attach the hot sides of the TEG modules to the aluminum plate. Use thermal grease between the aluminum plate and TEG module.
- Next secure the heat sinks to the cold sides of the TEG modules. Since we have two large aluminum heat sinks, we attach each heat sink to cold side of 3 TEGs  . 
- Heat sinks are partially submerged in the cold ocean water. This keeps the heat sink cool, which in turn keeps the cool side of the TEG module cold.
- Now , Float the whole device in water and allow the top aluminum plate to get hot in the sunlight. Within a few minutes the TEG will begin to

**6.3.2 Working Principle**

Heat from solar radiation heats the Aluminum surface which in turns heats the hot side of TEG. Cold side of TEG being attached to heat sink which in turn is in contact with Water source  as seen in above figure keeps the Cold side of TEG at cool temperature. 

A Fresnel lens concentrates the solar radiation to the the aluminum plate to achieve higher temperatures than otherwise possible. The difference in the temperature between two faces of TEG results in electricity generation in accordance with Seebeck Effect.

##### 7.3 Diagrams and Working

In the digester, the wastes are treated and biogas is produced. An
engine followed by an electricity generator then produces power. The
power is then transferred to the storage system (as depicted by the
black box) through electrical wires.

#### [8. Waste Heat Re-use](#table-of-contents)

#### 8.1 Requirements

**8.1.1 Geographical requirements**

The heat renewal system would work well under all weather and geographical conditions. Notably the system depends only on basic needs such as cooking. Therefore although the energy production is pretty less, it is still a reliable and sustainable way of generating electricity.

**8.1.2 Requirements from the house**

Our goal is to derive energy from heat sources within the house, most notably the cooking stove. Apart from the cooking stove (with two or more burners), presence of other heat producing devices such as geysers, A/C's can increase the energy production.

---

### 8.2 Specifications

**8.2.1 Components**

Building the heat renewal system involves the following devices:

(1) Thermoelectric Generators : Which is a solid state device that converts heat flux (temperature differences) directly into electrical energy through a phenomenon called the Seebeck effect (a form of thermoelectric effect).

<p align = "center">
	<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Ssh7JCR/TEG-Image-modified.jpg" alt="TEG Image-modified" border="0"></a>
</p>

Fig 8.1 Thermo electric generator 


(2) Household devices : Cooking stove (the primary requirement).

**8.2.2 Power generation**

The voltage generated as a result of the temperature difference between the two end of the TEG is depicted in the table below:

                                                                                                               
| 	Temperature	 (C)  |Open Circuit Voltage (V)|Current (mA)	|
|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|
|20                   | 0.97                   | 225            |
|40                   | 1.8                    | 368            |
|60                   | 2.4                    | 469            |
|80                   | 3.6                    | 558            |
|100                  | 4.8                    | 669            |

##### Table 8.1 (Characteristics of TEG)

Assuming the temp. difference (between the two plates of the TEG) to be 40˚ C, the power, P = 1.8 x 0.368 = 0.6624 W. This is the power of this single TEG.

Estimation of electricity generated from cooking : When we cook for 90 minutes, we can generate a current of nearly 16 x 0.368 A = 5.888 A throughout. This is enough to charge a 4.5 AH battery in under an hour.

The energy captured by our heat renewal system can be utilized to power small devices (for a reasonable period of time) such as:

-   A Led bulb which consumes around 7W-10W of power.
-   An average phone charger which consumes around 4W-5W.
-   An Extractor / Exhaust Fan which uses around 10-12 W of power.
-   Apart from these things, the power generated from the above waste heat can be used to charge lots of other chargeable devices such as Clock Radio, smart devices such as Amazon Echo and other small chargeable devices.

**8.2.3 Cost Analysis**

*Installation cost*

It is Rs 250 for each piece, so using around 40 TEGs in the house would cost us Rs 10,000. 

*Running and Maintenance Cost*

The device can bear a maximum temp. of 150˚ C, and thus can be used inside the houses, without a danger of damage. The device can up-to work 200,000 hours (around 22-23 years). 

Therefore, the system is a one time installment which will work for years.

**8.2.4 Vendor Information**

- TEGs are easily available and can be ordered online from many different electronics e-commerce websites such as [https://www.electronicscomp.com/](https://www.electronicscomp.com/) , [https://robu.in/](https://robu.in/) etc. Model name of TEG easily available in India is SP1848-27145. The approximate cost of this model is around Rs. 250 per unit in India.
- The other components of the heat renewal system are wires, charge controller and battery. Details for these components can be found in the section on Energy Storage And Distribution.

### 8.3  Diagrams and Working

**8.3.1 Working Principle** 

The TEG system contains two dissimilar thermoelectric materials joined at ends which acquire temperature gradient at ends upon application of heat and thereby, electrons flow towards cooler side. Thermoelectric genrators generate power directly from converting this temperature difference into electric voltage. 

<p align = "center">
	<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/yhfjVrZ/TEG-Working.png" alt="TEG (Working)" border="0"></a>

<center>                              Figure 8.2 Working of a TEG                        </center>

**8.3.2 Installation** 
	
We will install the TEG's around the burners in the kitchen. The dimensions of a TEG are 40 x 40 x 3.6 mm^3, so we could place 8 TEG's around each burner. So using two burners, we can place 16 TEGs around them. As the TEG has low thermal conductivity this ensures that the one side nearer to the flame becomes very hot, while the other side stays relatively much cooler, this then helps to create a voltage.

### 8.4 Closure

**8.4.1 Availability** 
-   Production plan for the heat renewal device : The production of the heat renewal device would be 20% more than the sale of the device till the end of sale of the product. This would ensure the availability of components and the device itself in case of replacement, repair and non-availability. 
-   Buying components from other sellers : All the components can be bought from any other electronic devices manufacturer in the market.

**8.4.2 Easy Maintenance**

- The heat renewal system includes only the TEGs, charge controller and battery. So the maintenance is minimal. 

**8.4.3 Replaceability**
    
-  End of life of heat renewal device - The components of heat renewal device (TEG module, battery and charge controller) will be available for repairing and replacement till 10 years (warranty) after the end of sale for the heat renewal device. 
 
-  Upgradability : The quality of the TEGs would improve over the time, thus it will be possible to incorporate more efficient TEGs into the system after say a period of 10 years.

##### 9.3 Diagrams and Working
Unlike living offgrid , offgrid and independent electrical systems are more complicated than normal electrical wiring and must contain the functionalities similar to a national grid like load balancing and maintaining a fairly constant frequency and voltage. The energy Storage and management system essentially does the following functions -
1.  Fills the gap between electricity generation and usage
2.  Combines multiple sources into one coherent output
3.  Tries to address the unreliability of renewable sources by providing backup power during disruptions
Solar photovoltaic power, being the most contributing in terms of energy production, has influenced the design of the battery system to be *DC coupled*, inspite of AC coupling being more easy to set up.

The following diagram gives us a brief description of the system.

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/nbvfFqb/week3jpg.jpg)
The system has been designed to be modular, allowing for: *easy installation, flexibility and user customization*  . Every energy source is paired with its own charge controller which is synchronized with other charge controllers for balanced charging. The chargers are then connected in parallel to both the battery and the inverter allowing for direct pass through of energy. The Inverter is then chosen in accordance with the overall expected system power usage.

The setup is same across all tiers with the main difference between each tier is in the capacity of power and storage.

### Closure

**Wind**
	    
According to different studies and data shared by the manufacturers of small horizontal-axis wind turbines, the average life span of a small wind turbine is nearly 20 years (with regular maintenance). The individual lifetime of the components specified above is given below to give a more thorough idea. It should be noted that the assigned lifetimes are those expected by the practitioners who manufactured the systems and can vary in the real world.

 | Parts                      | Lifetime |
 | :----------------: | :---------------: |
 | Blades | 20-25 years|
 | Gearbox | 8-10 years|
 | Generator | 15-20 years |
 | Tubular-steel tower | More than 25 years|
 
 Table 4: Lifespan of Wind Turbine Parts
 
However, a turbine's lifespan can be increased by regular monitoring and maintenance. This can be done by assessing the asset's state and comparing it to the turbine's predicted lifespan based on expected loads and fatigue, and environmental considerations for the wind energy location. By such regular assessments, one can know whether the continued operation of the turbine is possible or any components need replacing to extend its lifespan. However, the maintenance costs will increase as the structure ages.
