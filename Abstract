We are designing a modular energy generation system, which can be assembled completely or in parts depending on your geographical limitations and cost bearing capabilities.
We have mentioned the requirements needed (geographical/structural/machinery wise etc..) for each portion of the system to be assembled , and the user can choose the model which fits his/her budget after checking their geographical compatibility. For eg:- a user living in rural areas will benefit a lot from biogas based electricity (since there are lots of cowdung cakes around) while a user in urban area may not benefit so much from it but he/she might have better access to solar panels and can bear heavy one time costs.
Similarly areas with open spaces and strong gusty winds can use wind turbines, whereas areas which are enclosed like malls/complexes etc. might benefit more from peizoelectric tiles(since they attract loads of crowd and has people walking 24/7.)
Houses which have lot of people willing to exercise can benefit from bicycle powered generation , since there will be more man-power and so on.
We have in total provided with 8 different ways of electricity generation and a storage and distribution system, the limitation of this system is for those who can't use any of the 8 ways due to geographical boundations or cost unaffordability , although such conditions will be rare considering the variety of methods presented. Nonetheless, this system will cater to most people in varying amounts of effectiveness and feasibility.
The main idea is to have a modular system comprising of lots of options which can then be customized according to user's preferences. The following report contains all the information that a user needs to make the right choices for his/her customized version of the system. In fact an interactive app can be made where upon entering the geographical details and budget , it will make a suggestion for a system customized for that particular locale.
