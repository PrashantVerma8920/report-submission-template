##### Requirements

**Geographical requirements**

The heat renewal system would work well under all weather and geographical conditions. Notably the system depends only on basic needs such as cooking. Therefore although the energy production is pretty less, it is still a reliable and sustainable way of generating electricity.

**Requirements from the house**

Our goal is to derive energy from heat sources within the house, most notably the cooking stove. Apart from the cooking stove (with two or more burners), presence of other heat producing devices such as geysers, A/C's can increase the energy production.

##### Specifications

**Components**

Building the heat renewal system involves the following devices:

(1) Thermoelectric Generators : Which is a solid state device that converts heat flux (temperature differences) directly into electrical energy through a phenomenon called the Seebeck effect (a form of thermoelectric effect).

</p>

(2) Household devices : Cooking stove (the primary requirement)


**Power generation**

The voltage generated as a result of the temperature difference between the two end of the TEG is depicted in the table below:


| 	Temperature	 (C)  |Open Circuit Voltage (V)|Current (mA)	|
|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|
|20                   | 0.97                   | 225            |
|40                   | 1.8                    | 368            |
|60                   | 2.4                    | 469            |
|80                   | 3.6                    | 558            |
|100                  | 4.8                    | 669            |

Assuming the temp. difference (between the two plates of the TEG) to be 40˚ C, the power, P = 1.8 x 0.368 = 0.6624 W. This is the power of this single TEG.

Estimation of electricity generated from cooking : When we cook for 90 minutes, we can generate a current of nearly 16 x 0.368 A = 5.888 A throughout. This is enough to charge a 4.5 AH battery in under an hour.

The energy captured by our heat renewal system can be utilized to power small devices (for a reasonable period of time) such as:

-   A Led bulb which consumes around 7W-10W of power.
-   An average phone charger which consumes around 4W-5W.
-   An Extractor / Exhaust Fan which uses around 10-12 W of power.
-   Apart from these things, the power generated from the above waste heat can be used to charge lots of other chargeable devices such as Clock Radio, smart devices such as Amazon Echo and other small chargeable devices.


**Cost Analysis**

*Installation cost*

It is around Rs 250 for each piece, so using around 40 TEGs in the house would cost us Rs 10,000. 

*Running and Maintenance Cost*

The device can bear a maximum temp. of 150˚ C, and thus can be used inside the houses, without a danger of damage. The device can up-to work 200,000 hours (around 22-23 years). 

Therefore, the system is a one time installment which will work for years.

##### Diagrams and Working

</p>

**Working Principle** :  The TEG system contains two dissimilar thermoelectric materials joined at ends which acquire temperature gradient at ends upon application of heat and thereby, electrons flow towards cooler side. 

**Installation** : We will install the TEG's around the burners in the kitchen. The dimensions of a TEG are 40 x 40 x 3.6 mm^3, so we could place 8 TEG's around each burner. So using two burners, would allow 16 TEGs to generate a potential difference. On connecting the joined ends to a battery through charge controller, we can charge a battery which can be further utilized as an electricity source.
