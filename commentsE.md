# Tribe E:-

## Good points that we’d like to inculcate:-

### Documentation

-	Report looks neat with lines between sections.


### Solar Energy Section

-	The Requirement section lists all the requirements in a very systematic manner with mind maps and power requirement tables which makes the content easy to understand.
-	Along with specifications there are also pictures of all the devices which made it easier to find those specification details for a particular device in the report.

## Weak points that we’d like to avoid:-

     ### Documentation

-	Some isometric views(from fig.20 to fig.25) are given which are not needed. 
-	Lots of empty spaces present.  
-	Lots of unnecessary images included in the report like batteries, cables, connection wire, circuit breakers, fuses, etc.
-	Latex formats/syntax not rendered in the final pdf (html encoding format should be used).

     ### Solar Energy Section

-	Images are all colored.
-	There was no closure or conclusion section which is essential for the customer.
