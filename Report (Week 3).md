### Abstract 

We are designing a modular energy generation system, which can be assembled completely or in parts depending on your geographical limitations and cost bearing capabilities.
We have mentioned the requirements needed (geographical/structural/machinery wise etc..) for each portion of the system to be assembled , and the user can choose the model which fits his/her budget after checking their geographical compatibility. For eg:- a user living in rural areas will benefit a lot from biogas based electricity (since there are lots of cowdung cakes around) while a user in urban area may not benefit so much from it but he/she might have better access to solar panels and can bear heavy one time costs.
Similarly areas with open spaces and strong gusty winds can use wind turbines, whereas areas which are enclosed like malls/complexes etc. might benefit more from peizoelectric tiles(since they attract loads of crowd and has people walking 24/7.)
Houses which have lot of people willing to exercise can benefit from bicycle powered generation , since there will be more man-power and so on.
We have in total provided with 8 different ways of electricity generation and a storage and distribution system, the limitation of this system is for those who can't use any of the 8 ways due to geographical boundations or cost unaffordability , although such conditions will be rare considering the variety of methods presented. Nonetheless, this system will cater to most people in varying amounts of effectiveness and feasibility.
The main idea is to have a modular system comprising of lots of options which can then be customized according to user's preferences. The following report contains all the information that a user needs to make the right choices for his/her customized version of the system. In fact an interactive app can be made where upon entering the geographical details and budget , it will make a suggestion for a system customized for that particular locale.

#### Wind

##### Requirements

**Geographical requirements**

<p align = "center">
	<img src = "C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\ELP 305\ELP Vault\Wind Images\Wind Potential Map.jpeg" alt = "Wind  Potential Map"  | width = "500" height = "300" >
</p>


Though wind power is a very clean source of energy, it is not so easy to harness. To generate a good amount of electricity using wind power, one needs an average annual wind speed of at-least more than 5m/s. The above shown wind power potential map explains how the wind power potential is distributed across India? The states with the highest potential are Gujarat, J&K and Tamil Nadu where the average annual wind speed is above 5.6m/s. We can also see that in general, the potential is a lot higher in states along the western coast. 

**Other basic requirements**

- The wind turbine should be able to generate a power output to meet the basic energy requirements of a regular household like charging mobile phones and lighting small appliances.
- An inverter should be used to convert the erratic AC produced by the turbine into DC for energy storage and then back to smoother AC for direct use in the household.
- Energy storage grid should not be far away from the wind turbine to avoid power loss due to wire resistance.
- Turbine blades to be made of light materials like carbon fiber or fiber glass, or can also be 3D printed.
- Length of pole should be high enough to avoid any obstacles, such as trees, houses, in the surrounding and provide an uninterrupted stream flow.
- The mechanical parts of the turbine, for example, the gear box (used for increasing rpm) will be machined from high tensile steel to ensure wear resistance.

 | Output power              | ~210 W                       |
 

**Cost Analysis**

 | Part                                     | Cost    |
 |:----------------------------------------:|:-------:|
 | Nacelle                                  | ₹1,000  |
 | Rotor (Blades + Hub)                     | ₹3,000  |
 | Generator                                | ₹12,000 |
 | Tower                                    | ₹6,000  |
 | Other misc items like gearbox, wind vane, bolts, etc. | ₹2,000  |
 | **Total**                                | ₹24,000 |
    
  The above cost just entails the amount to get all the necessary parts to make the wind turbine excluding the labor cost. So, if we include the man-power needed to get it assembled and build the different parts, the turbine's entire prototype cost is projected to be ₹30,000. This is based on the best-case scenario quote, which excludes any remachining or unforeseen failures. Since there is the possibility of human mistake, accommodations must be taken to guarantee that an accurate situation is presented. As a result, some extra financing should be included to the cost estimate to cover for unanticipated losses.  Therefore, the net cost to make the wind turbine up and running will come about ₹34,000.



##### Diagrams and Working

Wind turbine designs involves looking over a lot of environmental and mechanical aspects for an efficient and sturdy electrical energy generation system. In our design, we have tried to considered a lot of these factors and have tried to keep the as real as possible. The actual construction of the wind turbine is a secondary objective and has been taken into optimum consideration during the design phase. But as the design of the wind turbine discussed below is based on existing technology investigated in the literature review and research process it's a little difficult to get the exact specifications ready for construction just by working on the design remotely, therefore, depending upon the resources available and the feasibility of the model the design discussed below can be altered.

Below is the CAD model of the small wind turbine along with brief description of some components:

- The blades and rotor are the parts of the turbine that interact with the wind and are designed to enhance efficiency. Blades are made of light materials with good wear and tear resistance, in this design we have used fibre-reinforced plastic. And to prevent the material from ageing, a layer of colored gel is applied to the blade and rotor's external surface.

- The horizontal axis small wind turbine (HAWT) is usually placed on a pole, preferably higher than 10 m, to lessen the impact of turbulent, sheared winds forming in close proximity to the ground. But since it is a small wind turbine with relatively less weight and comparably lower power output, the turbine can be put on a variety of existing structures, including roof tops, and rain water tanks, as long as it keeps the turbine's blades clear of the ground and in a continuous stream tube. Still, in our design we have taken a tubular steel pole for placing the wind turbine above obstacles in urban areas. This can be omitted depending on the place where you want to install the turbine and reduce the installation cost.

After the completion of the mechanical design of the wind turbine, the next step is to look after the electrical connections for energy storage and usage. The block diagram shown below shows the big picture of the all electrical connections necessary to get the wind turbine ready for electricity generation and daily household usage. More details about the connections is taken up in detail by the energy storage team ahead.

##### Diagrams and Working

![](https://imgur.com/1FH0bMG)


  - So firstly, solar energy falls on the solar panels. We make sure that solar panels are at the best angles for maximum exposure to the sunlight through an \*Active Solar Tracker\*.This device's sensors react with sunlight and angle the solar panels through drivers and motors accordingly. 
 
 - These solar panels are mounted on the roof with the help of mounting structures and they allow them to maintain and change their position according to the position of the sun. 
- These solar panels are made up of solar (or photovoltaic) cells that can be used to generate power via the photovoltaic effect. On the surface of solar panels, these cells are organised in a grid-like arrangement. As a result, it can alternatively be described as a collection of photovoltaic modules put on a supporting framework. A photovoltaic (PV) module is a 610 solar cell packaged and linked assembly. 

![](https://imgur.com/hBhp1j9)


 - After light strikes these photovoltaic cells they convert that kinetic energy of photons is absorbed by the electrons inside the material and they come out on the surface if this absorbed energy is greater than their work function. 
- These electrons also possess some kinetic energy and this energy can be converted into electric potential energy. This effect is called the photoelectric effect and it is the working principle for these solar panels. 
- This electric current generated is then transferred to the inverter through cables and wires and then it is stored in the batteries. This energy is then first converted to AC current through inverters and then is distributed in the house for usage.

#### Mechanical 

##### Requirements

**Geographical requirements**

System can work under all geographical conditions.


**Basic Requirements**

1. An average fit person (in the age range of 18 years - 45 years) can generate 115W of electricity from pedalling a cycle connected with a dynamo which means we can generate around 460w power for a household with four adults and 230w power for a household with two adults, an elite cyclist can generate upto 300W.

2. Geared DC Motor should be brushless as brushes make the efficiency of motors down to less than 40%,  which is miserable.
    
3. To operate the speed controller, we have to use a servo tester. The servo tester offers a physical dial, dialing which we can increase the speed of rotation of the motor. 


##### Specifications

**Components**

(1)  *Bicycle*:Here, it is used to rotate the motor using mechanical power, thus producing electricity.

(2) *DC Motor*:It helps in converting the mechanical energy through pedals into rotatory motion (the pedals generate force in the form of torque applied on the motor's shaft) which is then converted into electrical energy.Here, we have to remove the brushes of the geared brushed DC Motor as instead of providing lots of torque, it is not fast enough.

(3) *Lithium Ion Cells*:It is used to power the DC motor controller.Due to the limited space we have to use a pair of high discharge lithium polymer battery packs. Two 11.1v and 5200 mAh batteries required with a peak discharge of 25C which means that these batteries can provide nearly 130 amp of continuous current draw

(4) *Sprocket*:A sprocket or chain wheel is a profiled wheel with teeth that mesh with a chain, track or other perforated or indented material. To drive the rear wheel we need somewhere around 16N-m of torque and so the required speed is 50km/hr. Our sensorless speed controller can handle 22.2v max, so we can get around 350 rpm. With this setup and gear ratio 1:1 we can have the sufficient torque.

(5) *Chain*:It is used to connect rear sprocket to the dc motor to rotate  the motor.

(6) *Buck-Boost converter*:The buck–boost converter is a type of DC-to-DC converter (also known as a chopper) that has an output voltage magnitude that is either greater than or less than the input voltage magnitude. It is used to “step up” the DC voltage.


**Power generation **

Our project has 4 stationary bicycles as we are assuming a household of 4 members.Each stationary cycle when pedaled by an average fit person can generate 115watts of electricity and up to 300 watts when driven by an elite cyclist.

Let us assume that each cycle is rode for 2 hours a day.

Energy generated by all 4 bicycles on an average=115watts* 2hours* 4cycles=920wh=0.92Kwh=0.92units.


**Cost Analysis**

Installation Cost for 1 bicycle

| Part  |  Cost |
| :--------:  | :---------: |
|  Bicycle | Rs5,000  |
| Brushless DC Motor  |  Rs6,000  |
|Buck Boost converter| Rs 3000 |
|Power inverter| Rs 5000|
| Other misc items like battery, chain, sprocket | ₹4,000 |
| **Total** | Rs23,000  |

So, cost for installing 4 bicycle generators: 23000*4=Rs 92,000

*Maintenance Cost* :Negligible maintenance cost


##### Diagrams and Working

- Here DC motor works as DC generator. It has a flywheel attached to it which increases its moment of inertia meaning even if you stop cycling for a moment, the generator will spin by itself for a couple of seconds.

- The output of the generator is connected to a buck-boost converter, whose output is then fed to a power inverter which is finally driving the load. This is done to regulate the generated voltage to get its full use.

- In this setup, the buck boost converter is driven by a 3-60 v dc always stepping up or down to the input voltage to an exact output voltage of 22.2v dc.

- This 22.2v is then fed to a power inverter which steps up and reshapes it to 230v 50Hz ac.

- After charging the batteries, the inverter is removed and the output of the buck boost converter is directly attached to the two 11.1v batteries connected in series.

- Below is the model for our bicycle electricity generator

#### Hydroelectricity

##### Requirements

**Constructional Requirement**

The following are _constructional requirements_:

- *Raw Materials Availability*: For building the water inlet to the turbine we need PVC/RCC pipes, for construction mini dam Iron Rebar, Water impenetrable Concrete (Cement, Gravels soil etc.) or wooden boards for holding water.

- *Building Equipment*: The basic building tools and maintenance equipment  etc. should be easily available.

- *Other components*: Turbine blades, turbine casing, transmission wires etc.

**Geographical Requirements**

The _geographical requirements_ required for the plant are as follows:

- *Water Availability: The location should be such that it receives enough rain as for the plant to be feasible it should get enough water supply each year. The water body should be such that it is either deep like a lake (for increasing ‘height’) or it should be a flowing river in order to increase (‘Q: flow rate’).

- *Land*: The land should be rocky enough so that it bears the pressure by the dam and shouldn’t be swampy.

**Electrical Requirements**

The following are the _electrical requirements_:

- *Generator*: It should be rated for 1*kW* power generation at 500*rpm* with high efficiency and should be water-resistant.

- *Rectifier*: It should be rated for a minimum of 50*V* RMS.

- *Wires*: It should be rated to carry 30*A* of current and of sufficient length.


##### Specifications

**Components**

(1) *Turbine*

The water turbine is the heart of any hydro power plant. It consists of a number of metal or plastic blades fitted to a central rotating shaft or plate. Water flowing through the casing strikes the blades of the turbine producing torque and making the shaft rotate thus conversing K.E. for water to M.E.\*\*

   |                     |             |
    |:-------------------:|:-----------:|
    | Material of Turbine | Cast Iron   |
    | Blade Size          | 0.13 m      |
    | Water Flow Rate     | 0.03 m^3^/s |
    | Head Height         | 2 m to 4 m  |
    | Weight              | 10 kg       |

(2) *Generator*

Generators are used to convert rotational energy to electrical energy. The type of generator used here is the permanent magnet synchronous generator. This motor generates a single-phase AC output that needs to be converted to DC using a rectifier.

  |               |                    |
  | :-----------: | :----------------: |
  |     Model     |     BGWG-500WM     |
  |     Power     |        500W        |
  | Rated Voltage |       220 V        |
  |     Phase     |    Single Phase    |
  |  Rated Speed  | 500 rpm - 1500 rpm |
  |  Net Weight   |        15kg        |

(3) *AC-DC Converter*

As the generator gives AC output so to convert AC to DC for charging an AC-DC converter is used.

  |          |            |
      |:--------:|:----------:|
      | Model    | NPS-500 W |
      | Rated Power | 500 W |
      | Output Voltage | 24 V |
      | Max. Current | 28 A|


**Power generation**

The maximum hydropower power output is entirely dependent on how much head and flow is available at the site. The formula for power calculation is derived from the concept of stored potential energy in water at a certain height H(Head Height) and given by the formula:
	 
<p align = "center">
	
Power (P) = m * g * H~net~ * η
</p>

Here: m is the mass flow rate(kg/s), g is 9.81m/s^2^, H~net~ is the effective height of stored water, η is overall efficiency
	
Most of the Hydro-Electric systems used for domestic purposes have η about 75%.


  |                           |                              |
    |:-------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
    | Turbine type              | Axial Flow |
    | Water Flow Rate             | 30 kg/s                        |
    | Head Height               | 2.2 m                      |
    | Plant Efficiency             | 75 %                  |
    | Output power              | ~485 W                       |


**Cost Analysis**

*Total Installation Cost*

   | Part  |  Cost |
    | :--------:  | :---------: |
    |  Generator - Turbine Set | ₹18,500  |
    | AC-DC Converter  |  ₹3,500  |
    |  Pipes and Fittings |  ₹2,000  |
    | Construction Works |₹2,000  |
    | **Total** | ₹26,000  |

By above mentioned specifications and power output calculations, we can conclude that this system can help us run basic electric home appliances like television, fridge, mobile chargers etc. Also we can increase the power output by suitably choosing the location to get high flow rate like Northern Indian water-bodies have high flow rate. Thus, by suitably choosing the above mentioned devices we can increase the efficiency and can get higher electricity generation.

##### Diagrams and Working

As shown in the figure, water stored at high elevation falls on the turbine of generator i.e. converting the potential energy of water to mechanical energy of turbine by rotating it. Now, this mechanical energy of turbine is converted to electrical energy with the help of drives. Now this pulsating alternating current is passed through transformers for transmitting to distant use places and finally it passes through ac/dc converters to make it usable at required places.

#### Piezoelectricity


##### Requirements

**Geographical Limitations**

The power output of a particular piezoelectric energy harvester depends upon intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors include the frequency constant of the piezoelectric element, piezoelectric and mechanical properties of the material, and the temperature and stress dependence of the physical properties. Extrinsic factors comprise of the input vibration frequency, acceleration of the base/host structure, and the amplitude of the excitation. By choosing the right material for piezoelectric devices we can significantly reduce the effects of temperature on the performance. 
  
Thus, there are no particular geographical restrictions for building piezoelectric energy harvesters such as piezo-tiles. But in case of piezoelectric windturbines(blade and non-blade), it will have better efficiency in the western part of the country where average windspeed is above 10kmph as well as in hilly areas and near coastal regions.

#####  Diagrams and Working


Below are the CAD models and designs of the proposed piezoelectric energy harvesters with brief description of working model:

**Piezoelectric Tiles**

- <ins>_Working Model:_</ins> When a load is applied to the tile surface it moves in the downward direction. The projections on the tile surface come in contact with the piezo material. The applied force produces stresses inside piezo material which will produce electricity. There is clearance in between the springs and tile surface in order to provide free deflection. The spring is provided for stability as well as protecting the piezo material from getting damaged by an excess load applied. The base plate is fitted inside the frame firmly to provide support to the piezo material while compression. This kinetic energy is converted into electricity. This generated electricity is stored in the form of batteries, to which the rectifier is connected to get a pure dc supply.

  ![Circuit Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/6w4iz5z.jpg)
  


**Piezoelectric Wind Turbine**


- <ins>_Working Model:_</ins> The fundamental principle here is to convert the kinetic energy of air into physical-mechanical stress. After this, with the help of a piezoelectric sensor we covert that mechanical pressure into the alternating impulse of charge flow i.e. current. To saddle the active vitality of air, we use a vertical structure which is called the mast. The mast vibrations are converted into vertical stress on the piezoelectric sensors through a metal plate called Disc which is welded at fixed support of the mast. This vertical stress is transferred to another plate on which our whole piezoelectric circuit is placed. Now we have successfully converted the air kinetic energy into the normal stress on piezoelectric sensors. When stress is applied on the piezoelectric sensor i.e. piezoelectric chips they produce a charge which on connecting through wires produces current.

**Piezoelectric Shoes**

- <ins>_Working Model:_</ins> When a person walks, pressure is exerted on the ground and this pressure can be converted into electrical energy and it can be used to power electronic devices. A piezoelectric sensor pad is placed in the shoe. The power that is generated by piezoelectric sensors when a person walks is transferred to the battery using a full-wave bridge rectifier. A diode was soldered to each piezo pad, and a rectifier was soldered to the system before it was connected to the battery.

- The topside of the aluminum plate is painted black paint to improve heat absorption.
- Fresnel lens is used for concentrating more sunlight on aluminum sheet.
- Next attach the hot sides of the TEG modules to the aluminum plate. Use thermal grease between the aluminum plate and TEG module.
- Next secure the heat sinks to the cold sides of the TEG modules. Since we have two large aluminum heat sinks, we attach each heat sink to cold side of 3 TEGs  . 
- Heat sinks are partially submerged in the cold ocean water. This keeps the heat sink cool, which in turn keeps the cool side of the TEG module cold.
- Now , Float the whole device in water and allow the top aluminum plate to get hot in the sunlight. Within a few minutes the TEG will begin to
  generate electric power.

</p>


**Working Principle**

Heat from solar radiation heats the Aluminum surface which in turns heats the hot side of TEG. Cold side of TEG being attached to heat sink which in turn is in contact with Water source  as seen in above figure keeps the Cold side of TEG at cool temperature. 

A Fresnel lens concentrates the solar radiation to the the aluminum plate to achieve higher temperatures than otherwise possible. The difference in the temperature between two faces of TEG results in electricity generation in accordance with Seebeck Effect.

#### Reuse of wated heat

##### Requirements

**Geographical requirements**

The heat renewal system would work well under all weather and geographical conditions. Notably the system depends only on basic needs such as cooking. Therefore although the energy production is pretty less, it is still a reliable and sustainable way of generating electricity.

**Requirements from the house**

Our goal is to derive energy from heat sources within the house, most notably the cooking stove. Apart from the cooking stove (with two or more burners), presence of other heat producing devices such as geysers, A/C's can increase the energy production.

##### Specifications

**Components**

Building the heat renewal system involves the following devices:

(1) Thermoelectric Generators : Which is a solid state device that converts heat flux (temperature differences) directly into electrical energy through a phenomenon called the Seebeck effect (a form of thermoelectric effect).

</p>

(2) Household devices : Cooking stove (the primary requirement)


**Power generation**

The voltage generated as a result of the temperature difference between the two end of the TEG is depicted in the table below:


| 	Temperature	 (C)  |Open Circuit Voltage (V)|Current (mA)	|
|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|
|20                   | 0.97                   | 225            |
|40                   | 1.8                    | 368            |
|60                   | 2.4                    | 469            |
|80                   | 3.6                    | 558            |
|100                  | 4.8                    | 669            |

Assuming the temp. difference (between the two plates of the TEG) to be 40˚ C, the power, P = 1.8 x 0.368 = 0.6624 W. This is the power of this single TEG.

Estimation of electricity generated from cooking : When we cook for 90 minutes, we can generate a current of nearly 16 x 0.368 A = 5.888 A throughout. This is enough to charge a 4.5 AH battery in under an hour.

The energy captured by our heat renewal system can be utilized to power small devices (for a reasonable period of time) such as:

-   A Led bulb which consumes around 7W-10W of power.
-   An average phone charger which consumes around 4W-5W.
-   An Extractor / Exhaust Fan which uses around 10-12 W of power.
-   Apart from these things, the power generated from the above waste heat can be used to charge lots of other chargeable devices such as Clock Radio, smart devices such as Amazon Echo and other small chargeable devices.


**Cost Analysis**

*Installation cost*

It is around Rs 250 for each piece, so using around 40 TEGs in the house would cost us Rs 10,000. 

*Running and Maintenance Cost*

The device can bear a maximum temp. of 150˚ C, and thus can be used inside the houses, without a danger of damage. The device can up-to work 200,000 hours (around 22-23 years). 

Therefore, the system is a one time installment which will work for years.

##### Diagrams and Working

</p>

**Working Principle** :  The TEG system contains two dissimilar thermoelectric materials joined at ends which acquire temperature gradient at ends upon application of heat and thereby, electrons flow towards cooler side. Thermoelectric genrators generate power directly from converting this temperature difference into electric voltage.

	<img src = file:///C:/Users/DELL/Desktop/TEG.svg alt = "Stove (2)"  width = "600" height = "400" >
</p>

**Installation** : We will install the TEG's around the burners in the kitchen. The dimensions of a TEG are 40 x 40 x 3.6 mm^3, so we could place 8 TEG's around each burner. So using two burners, we can place 16 TEGs around them. As the TEG has low thermal conductivity this ensures that the one side nearer to the flame becomes very hot, while the other side stays relatively much cooler, this then helps to create a voltage. On connecting the joined ends to a battery through charge controller, we can charge a battery which can be further utilized as an electricity source.
