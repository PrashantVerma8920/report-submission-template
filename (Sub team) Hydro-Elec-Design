###### Requiements

**1. Constructional Requirement**

The following are _constructional requirements_:

- **Raw Materials Availability**: For building the water inlet to the turbine we need PVC/RCC pipes, for construction mini dam Iron Rebar, Water impenetrable Concrete (Cement, Gravels soil etc.) or wooden boards for holding water.

- **Building Equipment**: The basic building tools and maintenance equipment  etc. should be easily available.

- **Other components**: Turbine blades, turbine casing, transmission wires etc.

**2. Geographical Requirements**

The _geographical requirements_ required for the plant are as follows:

- **Water Availability**: The location should be such that it receives enough rain as for the plant to be feasible it should get enough water supply each year. The water body should be such that it is either deep like a lake (for increasing ‘height’) or it should be a flowing river in order to increase (‘Q: flow rate’).

- **Land**: The land should be rocky enough so that it bears the pressure by the dam and shouldn’t be swampy.

**3. Electrical Requirements**

The following are the _electrical requirements_:

- **Generator**: It should be rated for 1*kW* power generation at 500*rpm* with high efficiency and should be water-resistant.

- **Rectifier**: It should be rated for a minimum of 50*V* RMS.

- **Wires**: It should be rated to carry 30*A* of current and of sufficient length.

##### Specifications

- **Components**

  - **Turbine**

  The water turbine is the heart of any hydropower plant. It consists of a number of metal or plastic blades fitted to a central rotating shaft or plate. Water flowing through the casing strikes the blades of the turbine producing torque and making the shaft rotate thus conversing K.E. for water to M.E.\*\*

    |:-------------------:|:-----------:|
    | Material of Turbine | Cast Iron   |
    | Blade Size          | 0.13 m      |
    | Water Flow Rate     | 0.03 m^3^/s |
    | Head Height         | 2 m to 4 m  |
    | Weight              | 10 kg       |

  - **Generator**

  Generators are used to convert rotational energy to electrical energy. The type of generator used here is the permanent magnet synchronous generator. This motor generates a single-phase AC output that needs to be converted to DC using a rectifier.

  |  Rated Speed  | 500 rpm - 1500 rpm |
  |  Net Weight   |        15kg        |

  - **AC-DC Converter**

    As the generator gives AC output so to convert AC to DC for charging an AC-DC converter is used.

      |:--------:|:----------:|
      | Model    | NPS-500 W |
      | Rated Power | 500 W |
      | Output Voltage | 24 V |
      | Max. Current | 28 A|

- **Power Output**

       The maximum hydropower power output is entirely dependent on how much head and flow is available at the site. The formula for power calculation is derived from the concept of stored potential energy in water at a certain height H(Head Height) and given by the formula:
                                                    Power (P) = m * g * H~net~ * η
                                                               where:
                                                               m is the mass flow rate(kg/s)
                                                               g is 9.81m/s^2^
                                                               H~net~ is the effective height of stored water
                                                               η is overall efficiency
       Most of the Hydro-Electric systems used for domestic purposes have η about 75%.

    | Head Height               | 2.2 m                      |
    | Plant Efficiency             | 75 %                  |
    | Output power              | ~485 W                       |

- **Total Installation Cost**

    | Part  |  Cost |
    | :--------:  | :---------: |
    |  Generator - Turbine Set | ₹18,500  |
    | AC-DC Converter  |  ₹3,500  |
    |  Pipes and Fittings |  ₹2,000  |
    | Construction Works |₹2,000  |
    | **Total** | ₹26,000  |

- **Conclusion**

  By above mentioned specifications and power output calculations, we can conclude that this system can help us run basic electric home appliances like television, fridge, mobile chargers etc. Also we can increase the power output by suitably choosing the location to get high flow rate like Northern indian water-bodies have high flow rate. Thus, by suitably choosing the above mentioned devices we can increase the efficiency and can get higher electricity generation.

##### Design

    As shown in the figure, water stored at high elevation falls on the turbine of generator i.e. converting the potential energy of water to mechanical energy of turbine by rotating it. Now, this mechanical energy of turbine is converted to electrical energy with the help of drives. Now this pulsating alternating current is passed through transformers for transmitting to distant use places and finally it passes through ac/dc convertors to make it usable at required places.
