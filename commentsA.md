# Tribe A:-

## Good points that we’d like to inculcate:-
  
  ### Documentation

-	The format looks very neat with all the pages and sections numbered which makes it easier to refer to anything in the report  (usage of latex format).
-	Table of contents is dynamic even in the pdf format.  
  
   ### Team work

-	Judging from the gantt chart and the resource allocation chart, Team appears well managed and it shows that they used ProjectLibre well for setting deadlines.
-	Contains a lot of nice and concise diagrams which makes the report very interesting. 



## Weak points that we’d like to avoid:-

   ### Documentation 

-	Reverse anchoring to the table of contents is not done.

    ###  Technical content     
 
-	No need for designing a separate Solar charge controller, it’s already present in a solar inverter.
-	First step should have been to check for already available commercial solutions, then if it's not feasible or too costly only then circuit design should have been done.
-	Using only solar energy is not a good idea as solar energy comes with a lot of geographical limitations.
-	Cost Analysis breakup is not done. Quantity, quality and cost of raw material are not mentioned individually.
-	Wrong units used for energy
