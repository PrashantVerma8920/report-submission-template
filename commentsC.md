# Tribe C:-

## Good points that we’d like to inculcate:-

### Documentation

-	Reverse anchoring back to TOC is provided in the markdown format.

### Technical Content 

-	A modular system was presented which is designed not for just one particular geographical condition but for a general user in any part of the world, which allows for a huge freedom in terms of house design, location, usage, priority of sources and last but not the least, cost.
-	A tier based system is also provided to cater to the varying needs/limitations of the customer.      
-	Geographical requirements were provided in detail with maps for regions of feasibility.

 
## Weak points that we’d like to avoid:-

   ### Documentation

-	Some links in the list of tables are not properly done in markdown.
-	PDF not in proper format and seems to have been generated in a hurry.  
-	We should have used Latex.
