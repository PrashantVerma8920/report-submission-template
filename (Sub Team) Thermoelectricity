Thermoelectric system needs to achieve higher temperatures to produce electricity. For our system we consider the Hot regions of states Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. Particularly we are developing the system situated in IIT Delhi, Hauz Khas. It must be ensured that the system receives sunlight without any obstruction.

**6.2.1 Components**
   
(1)  TEG

A thermoelectric generator (TEG), also called a Seebeck generator, is a solid state device that converts heat flux (temperature differences) directly into electrical energy through a phenomenon called the Seebeck effect.

**6.2.3 Power generation**
        
- Power production depends on many factors such as sun, sun's direction, water temperature. Power transferred to load depends can't be computed as it depends heavily on several parameters of the battery system.
- We assume the water temperature is fixed at 30 degrees and the aluminum plate retains a temperature of 200+ degrees during sunlight hours. Each TEG produces 20W according to device ratings from the supplier. 
- Generated power in a day assuming 4 hours of good sunlight is = Time of Operation x Energy generated by Each TEG x Number of TEG = 5hr  20W  6 = 600 Whr/day = 0.6 Units/day. 
- Peak Power attained during peak temperature of the day is 35 W, average power during sunlight hours is 20W.
- This electricity is enough to power basic necessities in a remote place such as heat, charging, fan etc.

Maintenance cost is near to zero as we only need to ensure the sink is in contact with water. This system is capable of running for more than 12 Years. 



##### 6.3 Diagrams and Working  

**6.3.1 Construction**

- The topside of the aluminum plate placed horizontally is painted black paint to improve heat absorption.
- Fresnel lens placed horizontally is used for concentrating more sunlight on aluminum sheet. 
- Fresnel lens is mounted above the Aluminum Plate. Below the Aluminum plate, the hot side of TEG is in direct contact with plate by using thermal grease between the aluminum plate and TEG module.
- The heat sink is secured to the cold sides of the TEG modules, ensuring physical contact between them. Since we have two large aluminum heat sinks, we attach each heat sink to the cold side of 3 TEGs in our model.  
- Heat sinks are partially submerged in the cold ocean water. This keeps the heat sink cool, which in turn keeps the cool side of the TEG module cold through heat conduction. It is ensured that TEG is not in contact with water. 
- Float the whole device in a water bucket and the top aluminum plate to get hot in the sunlight.
  

  
  **6.3.2 Working Principle**

  <p align = "center">
	<img src = "https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/F93/ZNQ3/J7MFSOVQ/F93ZNQ3J7MFSOVQ.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&width=590&height=1024&fit=bounds&md=5d4d6abad4cf0be2298356cfaddbc183"  alt = "Thermo2"  | width = "600" height = "500" >
</p>

Heat from solar radiation heats the Aluminum surface which in turns heats the hot side of TEG. Cold side of TEG is attached to heatsink which in turn is in contact with Water source  as seen in the above figure, this keeps one side of TEG at Cool Temperatures through heat conduction. 

A Fresnel lens concentrates the solar radiation to the aluminum plate in order to achieve higher temperatures by procuring heat from a larger surface area. The heat is Concentrated on the aluminum plate and high temperature is obtained on the hot side of TEGs. Difference in the temperature between two faces of TEGs results in electricity generation in accordance with the Seebeck Effect.
