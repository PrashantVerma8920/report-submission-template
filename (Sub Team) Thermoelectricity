##### Requirements

**Geographical requirements**

The Solar TEG would work well under weather and geographical conditions having high sunlight access and hot temperatures.  Therefore regions near equator having lesser number of cloudy days is preferred.

**Requirements from the house**

Roof of thehouse must be horizantal plane in order to place the device. House shall use energy for basic needs only, no referigerators or AC's are installed in the house.

-  **Power Generation and Utilization**
     
      - Power production depends on many factors such as sun, sun's direction, water temperature. Power transferred to load depends can't be computed as it depends heavily on several parameters of battery system.
      - Generated power in a day assuming 4 hours of good sunlight is = Time of Operation x Energy generated by Each TEG x Number of TEG = 5hr * 20W * 6 = 600 Whr/day = 0.6 Units/day .
      - Peak Power 35 W, average power during sunlight hours is 20W 
     
- **Cost Analysis**
    
      - Cost to procure the products mentioned = Rs. 20,845
      - Cost to build a wooden frame to suppotr the device ~ Rs. 2500
      - Miscelleneous Cost including screws, paint etc. = Rs. 600
      - Maintanence cost is near to zero as we only need to ensure sink is in contact with water
      - Total Cost = Rs. 23,945 ~ Rs. 24,000

##### Diagrams and Working Principle

**Construction**

- The topside of the aluminum plate is painted black paint to improve heat absorption.
- Fresnal lens is used for concentrating more sunlight on aluminium sheet.
- Next attach the hot sides of the TEG modules to the aluminum plate. Use thermal grease between the aluminum plate and TEG module.
- Next secure the heat sinks to the cold sides of the TEG modules. Since we have two large aluminium heat 
  sinks, we attach each heat sink to cold side of 3 TEGs  . 
- Heat sinks are partially submerged in the cold ocean water. This keeps the heat sink cool, which in turn keeps the cool side of the TEG module cold.
- Now , Float the whole device in water and allow the top aluminum plate to get hot in the sunlight. Within a few minutes the TEG will begin to
  generate electric power.

**Working Princliple**

Heat from solar radiation heats the Aluminium surface which in turns heats the hot side of TEG. Cold side of TEG being attached to heat sink which in turn is in contact with Water source 
as seen in above figure keeps the Cold side of TEG at cool temperature. A fresnel lens concentrates the solar radiation to the the aluminium plate to achieve higher temperatures than
otherwise possible. The difference in the temperature between two faces of TEG results in electricity generation in accordance with Seebeck Effect.
