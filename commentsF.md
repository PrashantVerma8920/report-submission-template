## Good points that we’d like to inculcate:-
 
### Documentation 

-	Report is neat and easy to visualize.

-	The Installation section contains different sectional views of the power system which makes it easier to visualize things.

 ### Solar Energy section

-	The Requirements section is very concise and accurate.
-	Detailed and precise cost analysis
 

 ### Hydro Energy section

-	Full working cad model is provided for better visualization of the system.
-	Per watt electricity generation is very cost effective.
-	Detailed power generation analysis.


## Weak points that we’d like to avoid:-

  ### Documentation 

-	Mindmap fonts are tiny.
-	Lots of unnecessary figures are given like kitchen, fans, fridge etc.
-	Figures are of random size and wasting lots of space.
 
  ### Technical content

-	It doesn’t have a circuit diagram for electrical connections.
-	Unnecessary effort on CAD models instead of actual technical details.
-	Fuel cells are added which are unrealistic, unsafe, and costly.
-	No solution for Energy Storage.


   #### Solar Energy section

-	Technical contents could have been covered in more detail for Specifications, Requirements, Installation and Working of solar panels.
-	Power Generation analysis could have been covered in detail separately.


  #### Hydro Energy section

-	Report doesn’t contain any geographical limitations of where this project is feasible.
-	No information for wires used in this system.
-	Electrical specifications of current and voltage for power generation are not mentioned. 
-	Specifications don't contain ratings of generator and rectifier.


 #### Piezoelectricity Section

-	The piezo energy generation model chosen is not feasible and it depends highly on climate and weather conditions , thus restricting it geographically and seasonally.
-	Could have expanded more on the system and its specifications using better illustrations.
