# Tribe B:-

## Good points that we’d like to inculcate:-

   ### Documentation 

-	The Table of Contents was dynamic.
-	Reverse anchoring back to the Table of Contents is also done.

   ### Technical Content 

-	At the end of every section in the cost analysis part, payback time is mentioned which is very useful from the point of view of the customer.
-	An animated video was made which isn’t necessarily adding anything to the content but it looks great and the hard work is appreciated. 
-	Reuse section involved for various parts of Windmill which contributes to cost efficiency
-	Windmill characteristics curve was given which shows variation of output power with wind speed.

    #### Hydro Energy section

-	They have taken care of the uses of the generator when there will be insufficient water in the reservoir.

    #### Solar energy section

-	Analysis and diagrams are nice, concise and legible.
-	Cost analysis is very detailed which will remove any ambiguities in potential customers.




## Weak points that we’d like to avoid:-

   ### Documentation 
      
-	Lots of redundant images are given from different angles which aren’t adding anything to the report.
-	The report could have been more concise.
-	Formatting can be improved a bit more, especially word wrapping could be done more neatly.
-	For specifications, Tables can give a better picture for analysis.
-	Reduce the number of empty spaces in the documents.
-	In the solar subteam report, the formatting could’ve been a bit better and neat in Power generation and Cost analysis parts.
-	A figure of Wind Turbine could be introduced by labeling the parts which are discussed. 
-	References could have been presented in an organized manner. 


  ### Technical Content 

-	In the Biogas subteam report, they fail to account for wastages/inefficiencies involved in biogas production resulting in unrealistic estimates of production (i.e. 1000L biogas from 2kg waste). Further, they cite no references for their data here. 
-	Specific requirements for each type of source could be given like wind speed requirements, geographical limitations etc.
-	Unnecessary Explanation on working of Battery.
-	It's mentioned that “ lead acid batteries do not require any maintenance” (page 31). Lead acid battery technology is one of the most maintenance-intensive battery technologies. 
-	Wrong Giphy diagrammatic representation (inverter comes after battery while moving from source to house grid).
-	No moving mechanical component that is frequently used can function for 20 years without maintenance, and maintenance of wind turbines and micro hydro generators are significant but are not considered here. 


   #### Hydro Energy section

-	In the Micro Hydro Energy part they have not included the diagrams and circuit connections of the generator and the battery.
-	How the river water will reach the turbine and other constructions of the system are not shown in the report.
