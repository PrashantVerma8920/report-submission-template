# Tribe A:-

## Good points that we’d like to inculcate:-
  
    ### Documentation

-	The format looks very neat with all the pages and sections numbered which makes it easier to refer to anything in the report  (usage of latex format).
-	Table of contents is dynamic even in the pdf format.  
  
   ### Team work

-	Judging from the gantt chart and the resource allocation chart, Team appears well managed and it shows that they used ProjectLibre well for setting deadlines.
-	Contains a lot of nice and concise diagrams which makes the report very interesting. 



## Weak points that we’d like to avoid:-

     ### Documentation 

-	Reverse anchoring to the table of contents is not done.

    ###  Technical content     
 
-	No need for designing a separate Solar charge controller, it’s already present in a solar inverter.
-	First step should have been to check for already available commercial solutions, then if it's not feasible or too costly only then circuit design should have been done.
-	Using only solar energy is not a good idea as solar energy comes with a lot of geographical limitations.
-	Cost Analysis breakup is not done. Quantity, quality and cost of raw material are not mentioned individually.
-	Wrong units used for energy
Technical and design part of the team a report must be given 2 out of 6 for violating basic common sense.

# Tribe B:-

## Good points that we’d like to inculcate:-

     ### Documentation 

-	The Table of Contents was dynamic.
-	Reverse anchoring back to the Table of Contents is also done.

    ### Technical Content 

-	At the end of every section in the cost analysis part, payback time is mentioned which is very useful from the point of view of the customer.
-	An animated video was made which isn’t necessarily adding anything to the content but it looks great and the hard work is appreciated. 
-	Reuse section involved for various parts of Windmill which contributes to cost efficiency
-	Windmill characteristics curve was given which shows variation of output power with wind speed.

 ### Hydro Energy section

-	They have taken care of the uses of the generator when there will be insufficient water in the reservoir.

### Solar energy section

-	Analysis and diagrams are nice, concise and legible.
-	Cost analysis is very detailed which will remove any ambiguities in potential customers.






## Weak points that we’d like to avoid:-

    ### Documentation 
      
-	Lots of redundant images are given from different angles which aren’t adding anything to the report.
-	The report could have been more concise.
-	Formatting can be improved a bit more, especially word wrapping could be done more neatly.
-	For specifications, Tables can give a better picture for analysis.
-	Reduce the number of empty spaces in the documents.
-	In the solar subteam report, the formatting could’ve been a bit better and neat in Power generation and Cost analysis parts.
-	A figure of Wind Turbine could be introduced by labeling the parts which are discussed. 
-	References could have been presented in an organized manner. 


 ### Technical Content 

-	In the Biogas subteam report, they fail to account for wastages/inefficiencies involved in biogas production resulting in unrealistic estimates of production (i.e. 1000L biogas from 2kg waste). Further, they cite no references for their data here. 
-	Specific requirements for each type of source could be given like wind speed requirements, geographical limitations etc.
-	Unnecessary Explanation on working of Battery.
-	It's mentioned that “ lead acid batteries do not require any maintenance” (page 31). Lead acid battery technology is one of the most maintenance-intensive battery technologies. 
-	Wrong Giphy diagrammatic representation (inverter comes after battery while moving from source to house grid).
-	No moving mechanical component that is frequently used can function for 20 years without maintenance, and maintenance of wind turbines and micro hydro generators are significant but is not considered here. 


 ### Hydro Energy section

-	In the Micro Hydro Energy part they have not included the diagrams and circuit connections of the generator and the battery.
-	How the river water will reach the turbine and other constructions of the system are not shown in the report.

# Tribe C:-

## Good points that we’d like to inculcate:-

### Technical Content 

-	A modular system was presented which is designed not for just one particular geographical condition but for a general user in any part of the world, which allows for a huge freedom in terms of house design, location, usage, priority of sources and last but not the least, cost.
-	



## Weak points that we’d like to avoid:-

   ### Documentation

-	Some links in the list of tables are not properly done in markdown.
-	PDF not in proper format and seems to have been generated in a hurry

### Wind energy section

-	some diagrams of windmill could have been given after complete assembly to give more clarification.

### Biomass/combustion section

-	If the system is targeted for a user in chennai, how will anybody have enough space for a huge high pressure boiler, burner, turbine ..etc, and will the waste generated by an urban household be enough for its operation?
-	Usage of coal in a region of high population density for each house will result in severe worsening of air quality of the city.

### Energy storage section:-

-	In figure 38 all the batteries are shorted, and It doesn’t represent anything.
