**1.1 Requirements**

**1.1.1 Geographical requirements**

Though wind power is a very clean source of energy, it is not so easy to harness. The world map shown below depicts wind energy potential across the world. The regions marked in red have the highest wind power density and the regions marked in blue have the lowest. The measurements have been done in W/m: dark red shows potential over 1300 W/m and light blue shows potential less than 25 W/m. This map can be used to identify ideal regions to harness wind energy across the globe.

For an Indian household to generate a good amount of electricity using wind power, an average annual wind speed of more than 5m/s is needed. The wind power potential map shown below explains how the wind power potential is distributed across India. The states with the highest potential are Gujarat, J&K and Tamil Nadu where the average annual wind speed is above 5.6m/s. We can also see that the potential is a lot higher in states along the western coast.

**1.1.2 Other basic requirements**

- Energy storage grid should not be far away from the wind turbine to avoid power loss due to wire resistance.
- Turbine blades to be made of light materials like carbon fiber or fiber glass, or can also be 3D printed.
- Length of pole should be high enough to avoid any obstacles, such as trees, houses, in the surrounding and provide an uninterrupted stream flow.
- The mechanical parts of the turbine, for example, the gear box (used for increasing rpm) will be machined from high tensile steel to ensure wear resistance.

*Maintenance cost:* All practitioners recommend annual maintenance for the small wind turbine, which involves applying grease to bearings, maintaining the leading edge of wind turbine blades and providing a general inspection.  Therefore, a provision of one skilled mechanic at a daily wage of ₹784 is considered for the maintenance of the system.

**1.3 Diagrams and Working**

Wind turbine designs involve looking over many environmental and mechanical aspects for an efficient and sturdy electrical energy generation system. In our design, we have tried to consider a lot of these factors and kept the design as real as possible. 

Below is the CAD model of the small wind turbine, along with a brief description of some components:

- The blades and rotor are the turbine parts that interact with the wind and are designed to enhance efficiency. Blades are made of light materials with good wear and tear resistance. In this design, we have used fibre-reinforced plastic. And to prevent the material from ageing, a layer of coloured gel is applied to the blade and rotor's external surface. 

- The horizontal axis small wind turbine (HAWT) is usually placed on a pole, preferably higher than 10 m, to lessen the impact of turbulent, sheared winds forming close to the ground. But since it is a small wind turbine with relatively less weight and comparably lower power output, the turbine can be put on a variety of existing structures, including roof tops, and rain water tanks, as long as it keeps the turbine's blades clear of the ground and in a continuous stream tube. Still, in our design, we have taken a tubular steel pole for placing the wind turbine above obstacles in urban areas. This can be omitted depending on where you want to install the turbine and reduce the installation cost.

**1.4 Closure**

According to different studies and data shared by the manufacturers of small horizontal-axis wind turbines, the average life span of a small wind turbine is nearly 20 years (with regular maintenance). The individual lifetime of the components specified above is given below to give a more thorough idea. It should be noted that the assigned lifetimes are those expected by the practitioners who manufactured the systems and can vary in the real world.

<div align = "center">

| Parts                      | Lifespan |
| :----------------: | :---------------: |
| Blades | 20-25 years|
| Gearbox | 8-10 years|
| Generator | 15-20 years |
| Tubular-steel tower | More than 25 years|

  </div>
  
 <p align ="center">
  Table 4: Lifespan of Wind Turbine Parts
  </p>

However, a turbine's lifespan can be increased by regular monitoring and maintenance. This can be done by assessing the asset's state and comparing it to the turbine's predicted lifespan based on expected loads and fatigue, and environmental considerations for the wind energy location. By such regular assessments, one can know whether the continued operation of the turbine is possible or any components need replacing to extend its lifespan. However, the maintenance costs will increase as the structure ages.
